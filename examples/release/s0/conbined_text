S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-01350-01473 hi
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-02213-02502 oh just now uh i came from school i stay in the hall
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-02799-03026 uh i have one more paper next monday
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-03664-03872 uh currently in accounting
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-04187-04346 ya it was my first choice
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-04892-06697 oh okay um okay so like previously right cause normally on a normal basis right i like to do like a lot of community service ah so i was thinking of doing social work as um ya but then like after like i talk to a lot of people and like even like current social workers right then they were advising like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-06702-08877 i'm like still quite young lah so like then they say like it's better not to go straight and and start up as a social worker because like we all know that like social worker like their hours are long then like they don't get paid very high also unless you really have the like burning passion in you which you think can last for very long right then like you really shouldn't go for it lah like so like she say like since i remember this social worker once told me that like since like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-08890-09310 singapore is quite a practical society right then like you should
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-09365-15329 actually do something more practical first then like when you are more stable yourre financial you have financially more stable right then you move on to the social service sector in the future lah because like um you don't really need like a social degree to actually help people lah you can actually help it like and your own time anytime when you are free even when you are studying also so like she say it's better like you can go school on and do something more practical first so i like thinking through like a lot of different courses i know that i i definitely won't want to do engineering cause i've done research before and like really don't like it then like other aspect i science and i thought like uh after j c i thought enough ah science is that's it lah no more science already lah don't really like it also then like i'm not very language person also so then like i'm better if numbers la so i thought like accounting would be a better choice lah ya so after i thought so long then like i i thought my so just try for accounting lah like i a lot of people ask me that why don't just go for business lah but i i was thinking like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-100008-100412 different things ah ya be it like how to interact with people or be it your
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-100529-100725 paperwork and stuff ya
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-101042-101557 ya no more ah now it becomes very obvious to me also lah
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-101745-102132 ya he really like just scolded me for it you know then i was like wow
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-102161-102263 so
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-103009-103892 ya i was like i remember the exact word he said to me was like this place for ho for me is it wah i was like i shocked ah i didn't even know how to respond to that lah
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-104886-105025 
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-105033-105468 it's just everyday scolding about like how bad my paperwork is and stuff lah
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-106491-106741 erh ya got lah got lah i mean like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-106805-107766 we have to move on with life lah no point like you remember about this kind of bad things all the while because like even though like i didn't feel like he was a good superior part at least
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-107776-108273 i don't deny that i did learn things from him lah like you know how you deal with people and stuff
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-108305-108608 and how how you should present yourself ah because he was telling me like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-108615-108873 i remember at the end before i left right he told me like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-108911-109291 he was always very harsh on my paperwork because like he say subsequently when i go uni
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-109304-110183 i will understand why lah which i did understand now lah so like even though actually two weeks back there was a cohesion then i met him like we still talk like normal then like everything got so
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-110188-110360 okay lah ya because like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-110364-111122 no matter how bad something things are right like there's still always a a positive outcome to it ah it's just a perspective of life lah ya
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-111565-112133 at at the end ya lah during the time when never lah but at the end ya he he still did lah
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-113454-114923 ya sometimes like will lah like like oh my god what like my friends they are formatting but then i i'll just like err at the end i just to tie up all everything myself lah because like this not army lah or i i won't scold them or anything lah right i just do it myself lah ya everything is fine lah
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-116061-116379 m p s friends i will say no lah
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-116385-117339 but because like school school started only fourteen weeks ago lah like i won't say like they are so close until i mean i do have a group of close friends lah but
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-117349-119642 but m b s or everyone's busy with their own life then not really lah but i did ro a lot of my j c friends in to't go with me lah ya so like sometimes i volunteer lah then we will meet and then meet there also like a catch up also as you as you do volunteer work lah because now everyone is dispersed already what ya so so quite nice when you see them coming back also ya when you actually see your friends coming back together to volunteer with you so quite a nice feeling lah
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-121397-121709 oh uh okay ah okay for me right like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-121720-122379 i take quite a personal stance like in a sense that i try my to tell myself that i do not want to be too personal to them ah because like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-122492-122663 as you know like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-122671-124238 no dinner last forever lah so like at the end right like you have to part also lah so like i don't want to end up parting where everyone like very sad then emotional and and breakdown and cry and stuff ah because now more some some of them really will do that you know so like i told myself right like i will just like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-124256-125449 befriend them but like i don't want to get too personal to them also lah that's always my stance lah so la but then like it's also i feel like it's just just nice also because like even subsequently when they come back they still recognise you then they will still talk to you
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-125470-125745 and say hi to you ya so i thought like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-125754-126397 currently like i am at a quite a okay st ah like where the line is drawn just nice ah ya
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-126893-127203 oh oh wow okay i didn't know i talk so long
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-15331-15526 what an accounting student can do right
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-15559-16194 a business student cannot do but if a what a business student can do right an accounting student can do also lah so like if i do accounting is more like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-16209-16975 two in one also like it makes more sense lah to me lah ya so like after all this consideration i talk for quite a long period of time then i decided to do accounting
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-17590-18062 oh okay so like back then in my school in my j c right like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-18078-20644 uh every c c a in class right actually like every year you have to do c i p one like it's compulsory for us ah ya so then after that my c c a i remember then like my vice president he managed to link up with y m c a then like we started to do a c i p together lah then subsequently from then onwards right even though after i graduated even until now right i will still continue to do lah because like i found that i really enjoy what i'm doing enjoy already serving the community and helping people lah ya
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-21258-26743 uh okay so like uh because now currently right i do with quite a lot of different organisation also ah but for like let's say for y m c right so u y m c a part right i not not really say volunteering now already i'm more of like in the planning committee so like i always help to plan like the all the events organisation not the events and all the i mean the organising committee i also like then i help to plan all the events then help to recruit volunteers in already because like after you are you volunteer them for quite some time then they will usually want you to come and help then with all their planning and stuff also so for y m c a side right i more of helping to plan events now already rather than actually volunteering already ah which is also quite nice because like sometimes right you will see that regular volunteers also will keep coming back then they will slowly subsequently they also start to join you on board to help plan events then it' quite a nice feeling also ah ya then for my other
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-26802-27799 organisation but like recently i also joined like this organisation called health serve i'm not sure whether you know about it is it helps like all the foreign workers that are currently like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-27802-28473 they they suffer injuries during work then they cannot work now so like what help sir does is like they give them free medical services
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-28477-29389 to help them like treatment and then like they help them if they are get incurred in some law lawsuit because of their injury but then like their superior loan doesn't want to pay or what then
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-29402-29700 then they will help them to find lawyers also and like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-29713-31120 help help them settle because like when they come all the way to singapore they don't have any family or what they are also very they're at the loss ah so but for my part because like i'm not like medically trained or anything so what i also help to do is also like occasionally plan events for them
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-31132-33020 like more of them just tend to be there to be their friend you know to accompany them talk to them so that they don't feel like lonely ah because like when they don't work also right they really don't have anything else to do they just like every every time all the while have nothing to do lah ya but recently fine us la so like now to out a bit lah ya when i subsequently i will start continuing soon lah
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-33369-33498 currently year one
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-34259-34707 probably lah ya she was being like since j c even during my army
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-34724-35617 cause honestly like it doesn't really take that much of the time right like at most every saturday you just go do something ya for a few hours only like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-35631-35948 it's all how much time you are willing to commit lah this
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-36437-36594 prompt school last time ya
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-36981-39567 it ya because like back then in school right usually cause you know got c i p hours then last time you will always do for the sake of doing for the hours ah but then like subsequently for me at least ah like i found that i really actually enjoy it rather than just doing for the sake of the hours ah which is quite pointless lah then so even though until now i will still quite continue doing lah because like it really the satisfaction is there lah when you see that people really enjoy what you do for them ya
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-40367-41894 erh in hall not really lah i hor whole life food very tiring also ah but as in for n t u side i also recently as just joined the w s c side la ya im i went to join the de community to learn sign language also so
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-41904-42393 so like subsequently next year onwards also i i will be teaching their students tuition also
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-43470-44786 previously before i came uni cause like you know got a long period of waiting time then i went to learn ah but then after that when i found out that like n t u also got the deaf community then i joined them then they also send us for sign language classes also lah so recently all the classes just ended
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-44789-45140 then next year onwards we were when we teach the test students then
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-45149-45335 you will use it more often already lor
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-45535-45862 ah ya okay lah
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-48302-49567 oh uh currently for now and my plan is that i will just be an accountant for like a few years then until like i feel like more financially stable already then subsequently then next time i maybe then go over to the social service sector
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-49739-50511 but then of course when during my time as a accountant i will still like free time and just go and help also lah because like no harm or what ya
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-51401-52905 that one maybe next time lah since when got time then see how lah ya because like really lah you don't really need a paper certification to help you unless you really want to be like a full time social worker what then ya you need lah but for now is more i just want la
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-52925-53114 volunteer and help people ah because like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-53140-53836 i also know that like sometimes right your passion cannot really be your career lah because once it becomes your career right
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-53876-54214 it's a whole new ball game already lah like it will change lah a lot of things will change lah
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-56463-56563 uh
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-56584-57929 i won't really say every moment but it's more of like usually at the end of a like an event or or what because like some if you go back often right you realise that as in the beneficiaries of course they will recognise you ah so then like sometimes at the end right like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-57935-59977 at it when they just come to you right and then like some um they just like some some of them like young kids especially then they will just like hu you and then say thank you go ko or something then like wah that moment is like your heart will be like wah i met already ya but other than that i won't say there's a like major event that like impact me lah it's more of like usually at the end you know
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-59995-60213 a simple thank you like it's good enough already ah
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-61212-61912 usually as in currently right for me now right i trying to expose myself to the different kind of
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-62077-63328 different groups ya you get what you mean right so like i have helped like young kids lend the poor then the blind currently doing the death also like elderly also then like more or less i feel like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-63347-64086 oh okay lah but i just realised that i really cannot interact with elderly ah that's my conclusion ah so like it's not say la i don't want to help them or what but
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-64100-64800 i just got nothing to say with them you know like i remember this moment that i was just sitting at a table with another volunteer
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-64814-67779 then the the walle also quite new then we were with a whole table of elderly right then like both of us just like awkwardly sitting there like didn't know what to say you know then like because like it's not very nice you just talk all to one or two of them then you neglect the rest then like i don't really know how to like engage a group of elderly then because there's sometimes right elderly tend to be more sensitive then like i'm also afraid of like saying the wrong thing stuff so like usually right now right like if i can right i will avoid working with elderly lah it's not that i don't want to step out of my comfort zone but i've tried but like it just doesn't didn't work out lah so like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-67786-68277 besides elderly and most of the time i've exposed myself to most good already lah then like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-68287-68564 even foreign workers also now so like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-68602-68745 okay lah most of them
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-68764-68942 i'm okay with most of them ah
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-69101-70404 ya as in ya it's not it's not that i'm not okay with them like if sometimes if they ask me to go and help elderly i will still go lah but usually if i can ah i will just not go lah because like i really cannot interact just just maybe generation gap or something ah just can't la
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-70550-71126 then some of them like when they speak like hokkien to you then like you also don't understand then ya then the language barrier also there
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-71377-71486 ya
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-71587-71934 ya then like sometimes i understand but i don't how to reply them you know like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-74045-75711 err hobby ah usually i like to run lah my own ah but not not like on a competitive basis ah like own leisure run then sometimes run marathon here and there free time ya nothing much lah then if not means at home was was drama so stuff lah
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-75724-76107 ya but in hall in my hall i just play hockey ah but
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-76158-76989 i before uni i didn't have any like experience i just want to try something new also so ya other than that ya that's it lor
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-78545-78649 uh
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-78691-79123 wah okay err my army life ah i will say like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-79213-79523 it's fulfilling lah ya because like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-79533-80240 my whole of year one i was like really just doing like all the combat training like always go in the forest like almost
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-80248-80529 half half of the time is in the forest one ah then
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-80556-81497 loss of training then every time get scolding then like it's quite physically and mentally like draining la but then subsequently in year two when i
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-81503-83826 commission already cause i was in a officer ah so then i commission already right but then they posted me to h q ah i headquarter there then i do a lot of paperwork so then it's more because u like a totally different story because like what you learn how to fight in the forest is not relevant in how to do your paperwork ah so like but then like the good thing about my army life i feel like was that i learn both the hard skill and the soft skills la so like you
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-83830-84516 like hu skill wife like maybe like all the i i'm better than excel lor and words like how to do all the paperwork
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-84524-84802 but then like soft skills ah you really learn how to like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-84861-85805 deal with people lah like cause you really meet all kind of people be it your superior or your or your guys below you lah like you learn how to take a different approach
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-85831-86157 to to to different people ah because like some people right
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-86204-87618 even though like army people always think its discipline discipline but some people obviously they clearly don't care one la ya some people don't they they just don't bother lah so like you need to find like many different ways to approach them like if you want to get them to do things scolding doesn't always help you know like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-87636-88033 you you need to find like what's the right way to approach them some of them like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-88056-88683 it's better if you can approach them from a friend point of view but rather some of them like some of them is just like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-88733-89325 they they don't really want you no what ah to
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-89340-89511 around things lor ya
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-89515-90268 ya then like when you talk to your superior also like some of them just very anal about things you know like i remember once my superior right like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-90275-91766 my document i submitted like my report to him lah then then after that he look he he called me to his office right then after i ask him ya sir so um is there any wrong thing wrong with my thing lah then he pointed to to to me like this this pacing right in between two words right
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-91783-91927 then he ask me what's wrong
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-91958-93020 then i look at him like i don't see anything wrong ah then he said can't you this pay so big for who he ask me she say for me then i said err no sir then you double space for what
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-93052-93156 then i was like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-93239-94721 err okay sorry sir ya then i was like damn stuned ah because like double spacing like i didn't even realise it notice it but he actually i noticed that i double spaced by accident then like he made me redo the whole thing and like reprint the whole thing then she scolded me for wasting paper cause i didn't do my job properly but
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-94726-95893 i was just like in my mind thinking like if you are willing cause he doesn't like to read soft copy and he like to read hard copy then i was thinking like if you were willing to read soft copy then like i won't have to waste paper also right but then like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-95905-96201 also my fault lah cause like i double space lah ya lah
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-96236-96602 ya cause he's very inner about like all the formatting and paperwork lah
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-96616-100004 ya so like you really learn you really meet all kind of people in the army lah then like i thought like ya so i really like learn a lot in army ah ya but like then in a sense also like even though he was very strict on my paperwork ah like right now it help lah because like you do a lot of reports in uni and stuff right then i now become very aner also ah then like at the end of like reports right i will ill just tell my friend i will do the formatting la because like become habit already you know like all the font size might be the same must be the same fon spacing must be equal don't double space also ya it becomes a habit also then naturally so like i guess army already taught me a lot
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-04079-06472 oh okay um so okay so first you get to the bus stop right you can think either both one seven nine or one nine nine depending or which bus stop you are at so once you are at the bus stop right then you can just hop onto the bus because the bus is a loop service so it doesn't matter whether you' in the correct direction cause subsequently in the at the end you will end up at boon layy interchange so at bo lay interchange right then you got get onto the m r t

S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-24596-25279 when you get on to the purple line then after that if you do not want and you want to try more local food you can go the take the train
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-25298-26764 continue taking the purple line all the way down to saangoonon then from serangoon i'm not sure what bus you can take but i think you can check with the control station there then after that you can take a bus to the chong chong hawker centre and then like there's a lot of local delicacies there then you can try
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-27494-28758 oh okay um for for me right personally i really like to eat a barbecue chicken wing like then a barbecue stingray then um satay and like um

S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-30877-30991 uh
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-30994-33059 local drinks right um usually the fa more famous one ah all the ma te ri lah then like all the panung ah but all the local drinks are not drinks that i like ah i don't like any of them ah i don't like to drink the red lah te old lah all the things but like a lot of people like them so like i think you can try those kind of drinks ya

S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-34298-35198 empty lah like they don't add like milk or anything lah they don't anything into it that's what i know but because personally i don't like to drink them so i don't know the difference also ya
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-36598-37449 okay so like if you want to go for some sightseeing right then i would think that you can go to like gardens by the bay
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-37488-37707 or maybe sentosa
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-37712-38978 okay so like um if how to get there is like you if you same thing if you coming from n t u right then once you get on the green line from boon lay m r t then just take it down towards the pasir ris direction you can get off
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-39052-39840 if you want to go to gardens by the ba first you can get off at raffles place then after that you switch over to the red line and then you can get off at marina bay
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-39959-41132 then once you are at marina bay like the gardens by the bay like really nearby so it will be quite obvious la if you are not sure how to get there also you can ask the control station there then like the garden by the bay is like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-41165-41369 in my opinion it's just like um
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-41381-43528 a very big garden that that the government created to attract tourists lah so like but then the the scenery wise is quite nice like i feel like it's definitely worth a trip to go explore and most of the places are free although there's like some bus that you have to pay for so like optional whether you want to pay to enter those places but i think it's definitely worth like making a trip down
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-43547-43908 and it'll be best if you go at nine ah because it's a open area then like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-43920-45118 it'll be very hot if you go in the afternoon and like at night if you go there's also lighting to see so it's much more nice to go visit the gardens by the bed at the at night ah alternatively if you
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-45157-45408 just want to have to like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-45424-46180 enjoy yourself not say super more sightseeing but like if you just want to have a fun time then you can go to like sentosa
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-46214-46944 so sentosa side right like same thing right if you get from boon lay m r t you you will get off at ocean park station
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-46950-48020 then after that you switch over to a purple line towards harfront then you can get off at the harfront station so at the harurfront station you can either switch to their monorail which you have to pay four dollar for
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-48028-48577 orh you can just walk walk in via the broad walk which is currently free if i'm not wrong
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-48592-50027 ya then once you get to sentosa right there's a lot of things you can do there so although a lot of things are expensive there but like it's worth making like a trip down there so you can you can either like go for the universal studios there which is basically a theme park
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-50037-50271 or you can go to the
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-50295-51241 the wax museum okay to take a look there okay cause like the wax figure there actually quite cool ah quite nice ah ya if not you can just go to the beach and have a
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-51250-51712 fun time there to enjoy yourself at the beach get some sun taning
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-51721-52796 or let's play some beach games there with your friends if you are going with your friends or if not like at the sentosa you can just walk around cause the view there is actually quite scenic as well ah ya
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-53640-54847 oh for nightlife okay um depending on what kind of nightline you are referring to so like if you want to go like um drinking just purely like bar and pub then like you can consider going to holland village
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-54854-55995 or maybe even clark key there but uh personally i would think like holland village is a nicer place lah for drinking cause like they are they are mostly all pubs there so
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-56057-56163 people
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-56176-57091 it's more mature people go there lah i feel like in my opinion ah so like they won't there's it's less likely to have like troubles there la and then like there are a lot of
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-57155-60990 more mature adults you can see see that it goes there to drink so like you won't have to worry about like there being a headvoke ya so like how you can get to holland village is that you take the train also so from boon lay station also then you get down at boonna vista then you switch over the circle line towards um doby got or marina bay then after that you just take one stop and get off at holland village so then from holland village right once you come out from the station right like towards there at night you can see that there are a lot of pubs ah so you can see which one you would like to go to and have a drink there or alternatively alternatively if you um
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-61000-61580 you are looking to go towards like club or what or just or club and drinking then you can go towards club key
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-61611-61917 okay so clark key like how you can go there is like you can
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-61926-63111 get off at oceantra park same thing on the green line then you switch over to the purple line again then purple line towards punggol then after that you get off at clarke station so at clarkey station then from then on um
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-63119-64478 at night i think it's quite obvious where all the pub pubs and clubs pubs and clubs are so ya then from there you can like see where where you want to go to and like have a good time with your friends ya
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-66525-66684 okay
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-66831-67161 okay so the first one wake up your idea right so basically is
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-67186-68465 when someone usually your superior will use it towards you like when you mess up or like you just screw up something right then like he will it's a it's a form of scolding lah like to wake up your idea lah to basically like stop
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-68471-68636 messing things up and like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-68661-69460 start to be more organised and like know what you are doing ah ya so let's wake up your idea so ya usually it comes in the form of screaming at you ah
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-69583-70591 oh it's specy um this one i never really come across it before lah but i'm guessing that it refers to someone that is be spectacle i think i'm not very sure ah ya
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-70595-71039 never never came across nobody ever said that to me ah ya
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-71068-72389 okay so the next one is don't make your problem my problem ah this is a very famous like lingo that a lot of people it usually is also like also your superiors say to you lah so usually if if you cause some problem already right like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-72418-73873 somehow you screw up something and then you messed it up then you went to tell a superior then if your superior is not a very nice person that doesn't want to help you right usually i tell him um don't make your problem my problem ah so like in other words he tell him to go and solve your own problem ah ya
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-73978-75072 so the next one you think i thought who confirm right is usually when also same thing like usually when like sergeants tell their guys also when when their guys tell them like oh i thought like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-75088-77306 this is supposed to be done like that then i thought like oh i'm supposed to go there then usually if the superiors like very bad mood right then he'll be like you will think i thought then who confirm so like in other words in other words basically like don't make assumptions ah ya so bo shooter right the next one right is basically someone that cannot shoot well like every time you shoot you just miss
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-77308-77508 ya so we call them bobo shooters
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-77532-77719 okay drop twenty is just
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-77736-78340 also usually it happens in b m t then your sergeant just have drop twenty in other words you just need to do twenty push up
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-78466-78631 double up means
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-78643-79001 like double your speed up like walk faster ah basically
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-79050-79430 smoke out wah this one um a bit hard to explain
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-79434-79608 but basically
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-79658-79895 smoke out is like somebody will just throw like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-79950-80771 it can use both literally and figuratively lah smoke out basically if you say literally right like in the outfield training right you smoke smoke out then
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-80778-83750 once a person somebody will throw a smoke bomb then everyone else will run and withdraw from the place ah that's the literal meaning ah but figuratively right smoke out is basically someone like basically you you screw up something already right then after that they will somebody usually like the i c or some the leader of the that group right they will try and tell their superior some bullshit story and like like fake ah smoke smoke their way through and then like try and cover up the story ah ya so that's a figurative meaning of smoke out so depend the context
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-83782-83969 ya so wayang usually
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-84024-85591 it refers to someone that's very pretentious like in front of superiors ah so in front of superior they will act like they are very up there u very good ya but then like if when they're with their peer then they like they arere a totally different person ah so like very pretentious ah

S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-115456-115556 okay
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-11571-12828 language is the cambodia language so it translate to a everlasting hope and i mean the programmes department where we plan the bulk of the education and the construction there
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-12847-14275 so we have uh so we are planning to teach them english math science and mostly we are teaching grade one to six for the first part of the trip and then after that is our younger kids for the second part of the trip ya
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-14629-16744 because in the and the malay culture society perbayu right um o e was the only one which was humanitarian which one which was helping the kids ah and i know i was going to be heavily involved since it's a overseas expedition but then i wanted to try something new because last semester i was quite bored with just studying ya
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-17271-19081 so i i hope to um be more grateful with what i have and open my mind to more uh opportunities and because for me i'm more i'm not the kind that will take risk so i hope i'm hoping that with this o e i will take more risk during the trip and even after that also
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-19645-19773 um
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-19841-20868 ya we have mostly the vk is proposal but i don't mind because ever since in secondary school i enjoyed doing this admin proposal work and planning because i don't really like
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-20881-21837 um i don't really like know not knowing what the programme is so i rather be in control of the programme and know and like give my uh like two
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-21861-22867 my two cents worth of what i want the programme to be like know how i think it should be because i feel like if i wasn't in the programme team then i would i may not like what i'm doing ya
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-22945-23045 ya
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-23418-24305 ya more of uh knowing what i i have to do and in control of what i can do and whether it is beneficial for the kids or not ah ya
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-24853-27983 ya is um to educate the kids and to because even though we have um how to say like less advantage people in singapore's
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-27989-30000 um in even the people we talked to there like the staff there are aware that the people in singapore as disadvantage as those in cambodia and they are given food they are they have proper education and proper clothing and all so um in singapore i won't say that the
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-30045-30752 disadvantage are as bad as those abroad so i i want to go there and actually experience it first hand ya
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-31537-31681 m
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-32156-32400 ya
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-32533-32655 mm
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-32766-34285 big i think if i'm going with at least someone i'm comfortable with then i don't mind because i'm more of a people person and i need someone to lean on and uh i'm not the kind that will go on solo trips that like
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-34287-35650 will actually come out of my comfort zone and do all these things on my own because i want someone to be dependent on someone i can share with ah if i'm on the trip and if i'm going on this big kind of all the way to africa
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-35656-36574 then if it's with people that are coming with like family i don't mind going but if it's like new people that i don't haven't met before then i'm not comfortable in go ya
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-37466-37616 i think is
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-37629-38042 ya personally to me i think it's maybe uh just
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-38057-38314 the development like
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-38328-39316 if even if you don't have this basic things i guess you need to have a positive thinking and the government needs to learn how to adapt to the changing
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-39334-40091 changing climate of the world and actually continue developing instead of just staying stagnant at as a third world country ya
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-40500-40652 ya
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-40870-41016 mm
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-41403-41518 mm
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-41705-44462 i'm cause now i am staying in hall so i rarely have the chance to interact with my neighbours or anything and my house is at the it's at the area where it's at one corridor only has two units so i only have one other neighbour and i'm not mostly at home even though when even when i'm not in hall so i'm not at home like in secondary school or j c i'm rarely at home i'll always be in school so i rarely have the chance to interact with them so i would say that
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-44472-45045 uh i don't really help because ya i can't really help also at the same time ya
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-45254-45924 ya i have one other sister who is twenty nine now so it's a big age gap of nine years ya
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-46042-46506 ah no she's she's not married uh but she's working
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-46641-46819 ya she stays with my parents
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-46953-47377 uh she also not really close to the neighbours cause she
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-47411-49322 can be she's like i mean she's can be social she's socialable if you want to but if the other like cause my neighbours are not the kind that will be sociable also like the other just the one other neighbour so if they are not soable so i won't really go out my way to like oh hi how's your day that kind so it kind of like mine is like bounce off kind of social ya
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-49735-49849 friendly
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-49985-51554 oh no cause the one other unit ah that is along the corridor i me is uh we have the they keep changing so this is throughout my whole nineteen years is they are the third neighbour to live there already so before that was a um
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-51589-54707 was another family also but we weren't really close cause they they stayed there and then they moved out again because we had leave renovation work and they were had and they had a baby so they didn't want to stay there for long but before that we were very close to this uh other families because they always when they cook right then they will give us some leftovers or ya and then they also cause their families also always come over so whenever their families come then we also know their families ah and they are very friendly people so ya uh we are very close to their neighbour because
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-54719-55203 um i was in the same school as that neighbour also and she will
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-55207-56754 and whenever cause my i both my parents work and they have grandparents in that house so whenever after school i will actually go over to their house and like do my work or they will take care of me and feed me ya so that's like the nicest memory i have ah
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-56798-56901 ya
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-57175-58558 ya my parents are still in touch because they also still in i'm i stay in tampines and they still they also still stay in tampines so whenever they have weddings or any big gatherings they will invite my parents and ya har raya also they will invite my parents ya
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-59159-59274 uh
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-59404-61878 ya i think i'll continue being the bouncer also because i'm scared when whenever i become too friendly i'm scared that they will be like i'll be too intrusive into their life or cause even personally for myself if i'm not in the friendly mode i won't be i don't want anyone to be like oh hi how's your day one people to give me my space ya so maybe like there are certain people that are like that and i respect that lah
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-62153-62294 mm
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-62459-62563 mm
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-62679-63589 i think because they are the ones that will be there when you are not around at home and your home is where you always go to and without without them i feel
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-63620-65280 you won't have anyone to rely on if there's a there's a real emergency like for example if you're overseas or something and you need to water your plants or uh you left something behind or you just suspect something wrong with then you can always count on your neighbours ah ya
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-66133-66258 ya
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-66708-66949 ya cause um
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-66999-67981 i think it's good that the government has put in the you know the racial quota only certain risk can it up to a maximum quota and there are also
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-67998-70775 a lot of events that the g r c were organise i i think it's a g r c i'm not so sure but at the c c they will organise like oh if the chinese new come around then they will oh chinese new year gathering or har raya gathering or deepvavali gathering so it's like this kind of um small not say small but smaller scale events for the neighbourhood that can bring people together like and my father is also a like an r c member
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-70782-72390 ya so he is also in charge of like organising this thing and he pulls us along some time so from that also he can meet like people living around us and um we can meet our neighbours even though it might not be direct but at least it's within the same area
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-73804-74401 mm maybe by going to the um events then maybe pulling
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-74431-75079 if i know maybe pulling my friends along also ya cause i do have friends who stay in the same area
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-75100-77189 ya and actually and not just go ah but actually interact with the people there cause even though if you go also then if you don't interact then it's a bit u pointless so actually just go and interact and when you see the same few faces in the at the car park or at the void that or then just say hi ya that kind of thing
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-77394-77501 ya
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-78101-78525 language barrier language where not really because
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-78561-79161 only with the older people but my h d b don't really have that many
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-79163-79338 old people lah and
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-79375-80453 ya and most of them can speak english if it's the most basic english so at least can still understand each other and stuff and even though they cannot speak english they can actually speak malay so it's like
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-80475-81158 no so either way also still can communicate ya even though they are not malay they can still understand a bit of malay ya
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-81473-82030 uh how many this sem and last semester
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-82113-82443 ya because i'm in year one so ya so
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-82506-83235 ya ever since the start of me entering uni i've been in staying in hall but then last semester i stayed in hall twelve
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-83242-84193 alone like in a single room and because i wasn't sure of how i would act i would how i would like it if i had a roommate because all along i have been living on my own
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-84208-84580 then i stayed in hall twelve and i didn't really like it because
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-84603-86882 it was it didn't have any leave so ya so i and i stay on the seventh floor but then the first floor of like my where my staircase starts is at the fourth floor but it's because it's up slope to my hall so i didn't like that end there was only a laundry one laundry room at the fourth floor so i have to go all the way out go out the way out so it was quite tiring and i didn't like living on my own
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-86912-87260 ya and the hotel was very open like
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-87300-89780 there was it wasn't there wasn't any gender segregation so like the boys can access can can access to the female block and the female has access to the male block and even so right it's like a u shape and girls can see the boys'room and the boys can see the girl's room so it's like a bit of um i didn't like i didn't really like that was so awkward so i decided to go for tamarine which is like more
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-89785-90147 closed up and one level is one gender that kind ya
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-90391-90585 ya i have a roommate now
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-90651-92111 ya actually is like more fun with a roommate around because when i go home after school then i can talk to her about thing then i can tell her my o e stuff also then she tell me what she did also during the day so it's like going home to a family even though it's only one person ya
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-92392-93037 uh not really but when we pass by our neighbours then will actually like smile ah

S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-97642-97903 if i have to accommodate to her then it's a bit
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-97914-99028 uh uncomfortable for me so but in the end both of us are actually like like minded and we know each other before that also so it wasn't really awkward or anything ah ya it's more fun ah ya

S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-01052-01247 ya
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-01263-01410 ya
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-01597-02266 okay from kofu you will see this dim sum building okay sorry don't know what's dim sum
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-02285-02688 um it's like this building that looks like a bee hi
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-02753-02907 it like um
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-03050-04146 their big brown building with a lot of lines there's no corners it's all round ya so the that so you just have to work towards that building but if you are from
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-04167-05170 for the kofu you see the drinks stall and then you walk out to the outdoor eating area and you can be you will be able to see the high from the outdoor eating area and just walk towards there
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-05623-05977 here to the um the nearest bus stop
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-06084-06981 from koufu you see the outdoor eating area and there will be a slope downwards so you follow that slope downwards but
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-07001-07384 is opposite the hive so because at the
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-07393-08925 slope at the walkway down there are two sides one nearer to the hive and one opposite the hive so you go the one opposite to hive and then after that you go down then there's this one small staircase you have to go down that staircase that leads to a car park
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-08939-09619 and then you have to walk from that from after you go down the staircase and you see the car park you'll be able to see the bus stop
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-09631-09797 and um
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-09839-10336 just walk to the bus stop but it depends on whether you want to take the public bus or the shuttle bus
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-100047-100203 ya
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-100279-100465 mm
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-100708-101152 direct no diale is like very um
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-101193-101714 in uh it's how it's like you must like that so it's like
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-101726-103440 um there's no other way you can not do this so for example tutorials it's like you must die die do your tutorials if not like the pro school or something so it's in a way like uh you have no other you have no other choices you that that's the only thing you you need to you need can do ya
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-103459-103700 ya it's compulsory
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-104577-104710 throw face
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-104736-106088 um okay it it doesn't literally mean throw face but it's like a figure of speech so it's like for example you did something embarrassing so you like eh you throw face i think it's a direct translation from chinese word
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-10478-11063 okay so the shuttle bus we have campus loop rate which brings us around n t u
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-106101-106293 ya so it's like a
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-106339-107489 uh throw face like you do something shameless so for example um you when kofu is closing for example then ask hey do you have any leftovers there that that one that means you throw your face throw face ya
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-107533-108053 ya you embarrass yourself and you are not shameless and you are like shameless ya
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-108547-109404 so tong oh ya it is a food which means squid but then like squid is known to be um like very slow very
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-109422-110492 um it's normally called like blur blur sotong so it's like you don't know anything that's happening around you so for example if um in lessons you don't understand what the
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-110509-111478 what the professor is saying then you keep asking your friend then your friend will be like eh you so tong lah you means like eh you you are very unaware of all these things ya
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-11066-11609 but there's also another different route which is campus loop blue but that one is the opposite bus stop
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-111768-111906 so
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-111913-112424 ya like you ask like if for example someone doesn't know
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-112433-112966 uh okay for example you your two friends have been together for very long and you are quite shocked about then you like
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-112969-113688 then um you ask them oh my god you are together and they and then they will say eh you so tong lah you have been together for so long so it's like
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-113691-113852 like um
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-113866-114294 how come how can you not know it ya something very obvious ya
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-114759-114876 n t u
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-114993-115156 oh
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-115167-115781 ya okay cause ulu is like very uh secluded ya like n t u is like literally at
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-115809-116829 not even at pioneer is you s drop at pioneer it's like way deep into the jungle and normally n t u is called pulau n t u which translate to n t u island because it's like in a
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-116916-118143 it has its own boundary and no one else it takes so long to go there so ulu means secluded and away from civilization in ya in the n t u in the n t u meaning lah ya
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-11822-11956 oh that is free
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-118672-118854 ya no problem
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-11996-12518 but the students paid for it in their miscellaneous fees i think
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-12667-12838 uh if you are a student ya
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-12887-13080 oh ya then you bade for it too
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-13391-14483 the public bus is not free you have to use your concession card tap it tap and ya before boarding the bus then you can then you have to pay for it ya
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-14778-15179 uh the public bus is number one
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-15216-16288 seven nine it will stop at boon lay m m r t eh bo interchange or you can choose to alight at pioneer station ya
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-17003-17609 chinatown okay so chinatown is the purple line i think
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-17622-17990 so if you want to go wait let me find chinatown
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-18295-18459 no wait chinatown
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-18568-18950 ya chinatown is the north east line which is the purple line
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-18953-19113 so you have to take
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-19138-19756 from boon lay you take the m r t towards um pasir ris and then you take
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-19766-19986 all the way to orchard park
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-20061-20963 then from orchard park you have to change m r t you have to change your m r t line to the north east line which is the purple one is one stop away to chinatown
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-21076-21477 uh that one i'm not so sure cause i haven't been to autumn park station
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-21882-22321 oh ya you have ya you have to alight the train and walk
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-22327-22595 ya follow the science there ya ya
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-22940-24351 mm ya there is one near the tapping gentry where you can ask the staff working there or else they'll be doing peak hours there' will be er like m r t staff also guiding the
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-24401-24884 the passengers and like for crowd control so ya you can ask them also
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-25073-25266 ya no problem
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-25543-25770 chinatown
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-25789-25906 mm
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-26044-27512 uh it okay today is a weekday the trains will end around eleven p m i think but safe first you just take the train by ten thirty p m cause i'm not so sure also if not there will be other options like uber and grab ya
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-27637-28302 oh those are like car cars car car sharing car pooling services where you can
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-28323-28629 just pay the driver or
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-28633-29497 through your phone you can download the app grab or uber and you can uh book a ride using that phone app so
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-29539-30189 like at any time of the day twenty is twenty four hours so but it also depends on whether their car nearby to pick you up ya
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-30472-30958 um ya but i think it's relatively cheaper ya
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-31394-31570 ya
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-31805-32257 uh i think there are also bus alternatives
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-32354-32883 uh you can check at the google maps cause i'm also not so sure
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-33368-34141 ya it will tell you how to take the buses and also um the travelling time but normally the bus if you take
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-34172-34994 um at night then it not sure whether the bus will still be there but the bus services end later than the m r t services ya
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-35899-36314 woodlands uh woodlands is the red line
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-36326-36588 so you take from
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-36593-37364 koufu you take the same you go to the same bus stop which has the bus service one seven nine and then you take to pioneer m r t
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-37404-37513 uh
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-37537-37665 and let me check

S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-40305-40451 ah city hall
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-40472-40968 then city hall you change to the red line that means you alight the train and change
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-40977-41384 and change uh m r t line to the red line
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-41451-41705 oh you can stop at jurong east also

S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-44388-46477 or tampines they just recently okay not just recently ya last year they open a tampines hub so that has almost everything so they have like cafes like quite famous cafes they have a library they have a football stadium i think and they are about to have a swimming pool also so there's a lot of things that the
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-46528-46799 that people can do there ya and
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-46893-48621 ya it's open to public but certain things i think the football stadium is of course not uh not open to for the public to play or what but they can actually go in and watch i'm not so sure about that ya but the library open to public the swimming pool also just have to pay a entrance fee ya
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-48896-49659 for swimming pools there are it's like government owned i think so it's quite cheap maybe for adults is around two dollars
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-49668-49906 ya ya but is
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-49920-50238 it's just like maybe a few slides then um

S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-70564-70818 ya but it'll be quite dry i think
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-71929-72294 oh ya that is uh the half boiled egg

S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-01716-02014 true true uh i'm xavier and
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-02223-02444 my hobby is uh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-02538-02859 building skill models building uh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-02933-03080 toys and all that ya
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-03137-03454 i think it's a really nice hobby because err
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-03547-03660 i can
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-03740-04399 take a lot of time to sit down and just relax you know just slowly build things and
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-04454-04616 it helps to kill time and
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-04654-04841 trains my patience i think
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-05067-05260 the downside of this hobby is that
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-05305-05488 it it is quite expensive
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-05488-05596 ya
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-05714-05866 tools are expensive
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-06126-06383 they are expensive i think one bottle cost like
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-06512-06720 four dollar fifty cents and
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-06781-06933 it's only twenty five m l
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-07123-07414 ya but but we have to thin the pain ah so
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-07447-08145 it's not that bad but the tinner is also expensive i think two hundred and fifty m l costs like
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-08190-08386 twelve dollar fifty cents ya
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-08471-08730 the the thinner thinner for the paint ya
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-08839-09101 ya so it's quite an expensive hobby but
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-09220-10042 i think it's worth the the money because when i open up the modelcade ah which comes in a box
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-100201-100566 from your from your squat you know he comes out then he's
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-100666-101792 like in he he walks very like fibly you know like then looks very tired then people like eh it chao kag ah ya ya ya like eh eh cheo keg ah or eh john choo kang ya
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-101830-101942 ya our
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-10184-10542 uh the plastic parts ah usually they are
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-102024-102908 or like some sometimes when when we go to the track and run then some people run until like oh then they they stop then they orh che pain eh don't chao keng ya
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-103157-103374 ya that that word
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-103880-103997 ah
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-104115-104925 uh okay uh let let me think ah because after i i left ah i because you never use then you sort of
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-105500-105703 there's a lot lah there's a lot of
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-105724-106069 crazy things inside there so i think
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-10580-10839 grey in colour they have no colour basically so i have to
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-106132-106543 i think the the army side they have more lah but for for us we
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-106565-106873 we have lah but not so much ah i i remember there was one time
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-106910-107157 uh beginning of training that time right
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-107197-107533 everybody is still like blur blur sotong you know so
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-107780-108168 the trainer was like he was asking he was calling someone
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-108261-109783 uh and then they are that person you know instead of like replying yes sir or something like that he just ah so so the trainer actually ask him to to do like jumping jets at at the middle of the the
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-10909-11376 assemble them together and then have to pin them so the painting part is quite
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-109860-110057 the koi line lah which is like the
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-110082-110327 that small little open area below
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-110383-110635 the dormitory and all that so it's like blue jumping there
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-110675-112365 every time he do instead of like one two three four two three four he' like ah because he said ah so ah ah ah so so at ah haven't you have me e i think there's a there's like some curse one it's like so he right ah ah ah lam pa ah ah
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-112448-113629 ya ya la is testical uh iss at it's actually a hokkien dialect ya
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-113865-114057 i think he did that for like
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-114103-115365 i think twenty or thirty counts ah so so when he when he when he start to do right his voice is like normal like ah ah the more he do the more like out breath he get so so his voice start we ah
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-11431-11541 tedious
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-11595-12220 the assembling also quite tedious because there will be mistakes sometimes the manufacturer they
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-116179-116851 actually i found that i found that quite funny so there there was one time another guy actually made the same mistake again
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-116904-117938 so it one he he was asked to do then i i think something when i something inside me crack ah so i i i i actually voluntarily go and join
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-117972-118129 ya ya but
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-118241-119295 for i don't know why food usually people like this this their voice start to become really weird after the twenty count mine got really weird after the tenth count so
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-119319-120068 and and it it was so weird ah and it sounded so wrong that the trainer asked us to stop
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-120094-120363 ya
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-120673-120865 alright sure sure thank you
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-12377-12755 correct the mistake using all the party and stuff like that
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-13057-13876 the end product is quite satisfying because when especially when i take picture okay this is before and then wa after
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-13946-14401 can you can see the big difference lah usually i do this uh during the
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-14475-15159 in between the breaks for the semester so it's like okay december coming so during december maybe up ah
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-15206-15433 i will do a bit ya

S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-33288-33636 ya okay so
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-33636-33799 ya that's true
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-34615-35655 okay i didn't go for b m t this is the ya ya this is the really surprising part i a lot of people didn't know they thought everyone go through b m t but but no ya i i went straight to

S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-36148-36538 i i i don't know also because ya when when the letter came is like
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-36538-36663 huh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-36663-37145 at home team academy i thought supposed to be like usually people like get tekong
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-37183-37771 okay and i was like a bit worried ah because it's like different from other people i don't know what to expect
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-37792-38631 because every time in in the media in t v show and movie they always show people uh going to tekong and all that ya
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-38664-39003 so i i one of those like outliers ya
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-39369-40124 they they didn't say they just uh give a letterr so i just just went lah anyway i have to go
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-40368-41007 oh uh we train for uh i think four months at home team academy but basically
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-41187-41563 like physical training uh pen code all that
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-41610-41745 then some
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-42114-43035 i i don't want to say kung fu but you know some some anam like tactics and all that ya then firearms ya
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-43278-43432 ah ya ya same duration
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-43947-44318 basically okay because home team is
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-44541-45225 there's there's a lot of agencies in in home team ah so i i can say that because everybody can you can go and find that out yourself so it's okay
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-45280-45785 ya there's quite a few ah there's like police civil defence the the fire truck all that
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-45821-45950 as many other like
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-45992-46402 those other supporting agencies ah but the biggest one is
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-46445-46697 the police force ah so basically we
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-46739-47200 after training we graduate then we we are actually like uh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-47395-48979 they they they say special constabulary ya so it's like it sounds very like wow but actually it's it's just like n s police officers ah basically so just go out there u assist the regular in their patrol all that
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-49184-50139 oh okay m r t is a separate unit so after the training right that when when everybody pass out right do uh people different people go to different like
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-50165-50432 so called vocation so the m r t one is
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-50479-50733 another different one they will like
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-50769-51319 they will patrol around the areas in the m r t areas surrounding m r t
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-51369-51574 for me different i went to the

S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-60271-60812 my tentative plan right is to right after i graduate i just go and sign up
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-60852-61311 ya or or right before because they always have like roadshow every now and then
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-61311-62914 ya something but i think if you join them they might like um think for your studies if i'm not wrong because i know there are a few friends that go to s i a humanology paid by the depending on i guess which im
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-63123-63545 ya they they do they do sponsor like uh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-63592-63784 further studies lah so you
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-63896-64933 i think there's like two two rub ah one is like the really atas the really high class the scholar that that kind they they will just pay immediately then you after you finish and come and join in
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-64959-65385 the other one is i think is those like you join them and you work
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-65466-65795 for a while then after that they will they will let you go and study
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-65795-66151 ya
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-66151-66861 actually i prefer the progression one because the scholar one very i think quite stress ah they they will have like some sort of standard ah like
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-66882-67013 g p a must be the
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-67037-67677 wah very stress already very stress already like like by by itself ah studying like that very stress already so
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-68015-68596 give myself less stress is is better ah don't don't stress myself out too much ya
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-69533-70366 uh wow a lot of a lot of thing ah but okay lah the the highlight part was the the really
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-70512-70769 the part that really outshine everything was uh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-70844-71017 the day when i
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-71039-71183 graduate from training

S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-71800-71948 that there was a point in time
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-71975-72131 halfway through training
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-72150-72305 very demoralised i

S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-77006-77811 i could have you know excelled but i didn't i i chose the e c way out you know like like chao keng
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-77863-78239 uh don't do uh for say m c
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-78329-78879 so that that at that point in time i was i i contemplated about it lah so i
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-78934-79179 i started to put in more effort and all that
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-79200-79572 so on the day when graduate orh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-79596-79759 i was quite happy because
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-79860-80356 i they they actually have this scheme ah you can when you graduate you
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-80485-80946 can get direct promotion some people don't lah depends on performance
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-80984-81448 so wah i managed to call it lah so i i was quite happy at that time
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-81448-81659 uh ya
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-81659-82180 oh okay usually when when we graduate right here is nothing one
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-82221-82332 ya but
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-82443-83021 for me and and uh some other people when they graduate they got corporate ya so
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-83099-83631 so when you go out right you go out to the different vocation you

S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-83982-84435 the your next promotion is sergeant eh so the the at that time everybody was like
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-84469-84988 we must get the highest n s pay possible because n s pay is quite quite little lah so
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-85013-85452 at that time i think the sergeant pay was like one thousand uh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-85532-85723 one hundred or two hundred ya
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-85809-86059 ya so it's it's quite a lot so everybody is like

S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-88404-88545 scheme recently
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-88666-89460 ya my i think for me to promote to the for me to change the the you know the the rank down here will take a bit longer

S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-90440-90577 yes
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-90798-91385 okay chao kang basically is uh from what i understand it's
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-91554-92338 you are supposed to do certain duties or you are supposed to you are expected to do certain things carry out certain task
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-92553-93084 because of uh laziness or or whatever reasons that the person have right
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-93240-93495 either a faint illness you know
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-93519-93708 oh i i sick i go and see doctor
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-93741-94249 i get light duty gas you know i got ti you know to basically just to avoid
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-94272-94582 avoid uh doing whatever their their
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-94624-94889 supposed to do lah so i think they have a
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-94951-95812 they have a very nice word for it called i think they call itingering or something ya ya ya ya that there's a term for that also ya
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-96162-97226 ya ya it i i i last time a four period of time i i had that kind of mindset ah so that i fortunately i i managed to change ah because i think ah if i i didn't ah
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-97300-97607 even after n s right i think i i still have this kind of
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-97629-97945 mindset ya and then it will affect
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-97979-98200 my life also ya
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-98917-99121 like okay usually uh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-99175-99480 uh okay i put a situation for you ah so
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-99518-100133 like err example in in during training okay we you you see this guy from
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-00142-00774 i just came to singapore
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-01310-01922 uh no i don't stay in hall because ya i stay quite near to n t u so
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-03034-03901 okay if you are at the s a c and you want to go to coffee bin right okay you exit a s a c and
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-03926-04031 you
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-04247-04421 just walk straight down
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-04478-04670 you will pass by uh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-04705-04877 i think the printing
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-04909-05725 some printing shop tire right and then you work just keep walking straight down you pass by the bus that that convenience store
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-05802-06545 keep walking straight you are that there will be this like open plaza thing there's a giant t v down there you can't miss it
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-06736-06998 on the left i think there's bookling and
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-07041-08144 prime supermarket i i can't remember what's on the right because ya i i know there's dunkin donors ya that's just so you just walk straight down then they will uh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-08224-09266 you that you can go to the to your left or to your right but i think to your right is better because i usually take the to the the path to the right so you just
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-09288-09688 turn right and then you turn left again there will be a long long path down
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-09746-10094 ya so you just keep walking down that path and
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-100014-100474 ya ya so we are quite a materialistic society
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-100621-100739 uh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-101014-101263 a bud a buang is like
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-101293-101953 uh it's a local slang of like saying uh you don't say you know like ya you don't say you don't say
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-10156-10277 you will
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-102122-102273 uh like
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-102322-102897 okay i give you a hypothetical scenario so uh for example you know i
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-103039-103155 i
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-103248-103382 i went to the
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-103450-104664 the toilet to take a dump ya and then and then you you came by and then you ask me eh when you take a dump did you take off your pan so like abu there of course ya ya
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-104766-104886 ya
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-104958-105079 uh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-105360-105745 act blur act blur basically is uh like
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-105874-106507 it's also ya all of these are singapore's
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-106536-106735 uh usually applies to
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-10670-11094 uh you pass by this sort of like crossing
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-106824-107644 people in national service sometimes it applies to uh people in the working like scenario also so
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-107869-108652 act blur is like pretending to not know something when you actually you know like you know like for example like
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-108680-109293 uh i was given assignment by my supervisor to do like this this
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-109385-109596 task x ya let's say
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-109639-110051 but he he announced it in a meeting but you know i'm
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-110147-110599 i i just like choose not the answer or or what aler so i choose not to
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-110748-112367 know that oh overly know that you know i have a task to do so when the day get like deadline for task x come ah oh you know oh i i i didn't know that i have such a task you know uh oh did did you did you say such a thing no ah ya ya ya so this is act blur
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-11233-12047 but there will be no cars usually the car won't drive pass there they will usually make eus so you can just walk pass there then you just keep walking down
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-112491-112765 uh act cute ya
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-112877-114026 it just literally means like someone trying to like act really cute ya it it usually applies to to like girls ya who who try to you know talk in like squeaky voice like
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-114076-114273 ya no ah
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-114295-114447 ya ya so
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-114472-114632 usually when when
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-114666-116142 when people see that usually it's from a third party perspective so it's like uh like you and me we are sitting here and then like the opposite table that there's this girl over there who's like u like doing like this kind of things to some guy then i'll be like
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-116190-116341 err you want to look at the girl
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-116511-116661 ya ya
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-116747-117066 so action ya uh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-117295-118301 action usually is is also another like exclamation to use to like uh disapprove of what somebody does so like
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-118416-119559 uh for example if a a a guy comes up to the stage to do a speech you know usually people walk in walk walk to the stage to do a speech maybe he somersaults
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-119598-120707 like you know across the stage and then he lands right in front of the podium to do the speech so when he does that people will will be like sitting at the audience like wah this guy action ah you know like like trying to like
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-120859-120960 uh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-121001-121331 such acts such behaviour
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-12116-12408 and i think you can see coffee bean
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-121356-121900 it's not really necessary so that hence action
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-121900-122083 ya
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-122083-122197 yes
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-122249-122978 ya agar agar basically is uh estimation ya it so it's like
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-123045-123151 uh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-123259-124227 you know the like during perhaps during exams you know uh when we we are done with the exams then you know group of local students outside discussing
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-124296-125063 so so maybe one of them ask eh how did you do like this uh question five and then the other guy will be like oh i just agar agar er you know
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-125133-125297 throw in the formula
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-125326-125634 add the numbers in you know and get the answer so
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-125661-126086 uh it's like a rough rough estimation
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-126133-126747 uh how or of how people do stuff ya it applies to a lot of things
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-126779-127034 like not not even like studying like can be
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-127299-127843 maybe at while we are waiting for the bus eh how long will the bus come uh agar agar maybe like
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-127924-128227 ten minutes ya estimated ten minutes ya
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-128815-129317 ya sure ya alright right glad to help thank you
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-12986-14463 okay uh kofu it is basically the same thing e you just have to walk straight for a long time so uh what you do is uh you can either choose to take the elevator or you can choose to walk down the stairs so
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-14499-14856 uh if you want to take the elevator you just need to
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-15149-15369 pass coffee bean turn left
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-15436-15954 uh and then there will be a row of like benches face uh to the side
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-16035-16268 of the path and then just walk down straight
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-16304-16843 and then there will be elevator so you just take the elevator down to the lowest level
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-16868-17231 i think eh is it lowest or second lowest
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-17256-17496 ah second lowest
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-17601-17820 and then you'll be
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-17909-18249 the bottom if you choose to take the stairs eh you have to
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-18281-18473 walk out of coffee bean
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-18531-19468 turn right you will see like flight of like zigzag not zigzagging ah but jagged stairs you know like so you just walk walk down the stairs all the way
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-19519-20379 so comparing those two areas right you you come down by the elevator you will be like to the right side of the long path down the kofu
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-20401-20623 if you come down by stairs you will be on the left side
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-20684-21688 both are the same you just walk straight down if you are on either side just walk straight down all the way you will pass by some l uh l ts ya
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-21718-22022 and then finally you will see uh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-22066-22808 the lee kong chian lecture theatre the lee kong chian l t that's like a very nice looking l t
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-22855-23048 so when you see that uh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-23074-23561 you can there will be a a flight of stairs now so just take the flight of stairs now
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-23612-23929 and then once you reach the end of the flood the stairs you just
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-23979-24118 do a u ten
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-24278-24460 you you can see koufu
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-25152-25513 uh kofu basically is like a
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-25617-25864 uh what what they call ah uh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-25958-26451 mm you want to say it's not a hawker centre but it's it's more of like a food court
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-26470-26575 food court ya
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-26664-27774 so you you can see a lot of these err around singapore's koufu is actually one of those
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-27987-28385 companies ah that that operate food courts around so
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-28463-29658 they this kind of food courts they usually cater food to everyone's taste ya they try to cater to everyone's taste so that that that's why you see that's like
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-29739-30286 there's like indian food there's like there's like malay food there's there's chicken rice there
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-30316-31294 chinese food there's the mixed vegetable rice you know got all the ingredients there and there's like noodles laksa western western food there's pasta there
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-31341-31463 and all that ya
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-33234-33448 okay uh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-33579-34177 i think a really nice one would be fried rice
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-34216-34346 because uh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-34479-34838 most of the time the the i think
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-34914-35312 the western uh students from western countries they they seldom have
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-35519-36138 like exposure to fried rice even if you know that there's like other exchange students from
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-36169-36648 from other asian countries that there's like different varieties of
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-36676-37035 fried ri so maybe the local one might might taste different
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-37056-37466 my different taste because i myself i like to try like different varieties of
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-37501-37976 fried rice there's there's no one type of fried rice there's so many types there's like uh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-38015-38252 salted fish fried rice there's like
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-38277-38893 so i i can't even recall there's just too too too many e then there's like silver fish fried rice
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-38939-39121 ya silver fish is like
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-39186-39430 is is a
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-39664-41105 i i want to call it ikan beies but but it's it's not it is basically like a really small like white fish you can you can eat the whole whole thing because they they fry and then it's so crispy you can just ya eat the whole thing
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-41299-41462 oh okay uh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-41530-42276 the english word for can beli right is actually an an chies ya so it is really just small fish that
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-42359-42922 uh how they cook it in the local style is that usually they will deep fry it
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-42945-43291 so it's really crispy you can just you know eat the whole thing and
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-43318-43570 ya it's very crunchy ya
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-43701-45229 uh i used to do that but now not really because it will give me like so cho and all that so usually i have it with like mm rice all or all usually they come they come with uh nasi lemak ya
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-45281-46009 uh okay nasi lemak is actually uh a malay cuisine malay food so uh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-46037-46459 i think the literal translation is like i think lermak is
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-46494-47265 fat or something ya and and and nasi is rice so why why there's like lemak there's like fat i think it's because of
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-47304-47893 they when they cook the rice they they cook it with coconut milk ya so
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-47918-48421 that there's this like a very nice aroma very nice uh smell in it
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-48463-49074 but but it's a kind of fattening also ya ya and and they they accompany that rise with
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-49290-49933 quite a few ingredients that's theyccompd with ya like what what i said just now i canles peanuts
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-50018-50759 uh fried chicken ya usually the fried chicken wings ya they taste really nice and sometimes they
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-50823-51246 they pair up with uh fried fish the ik ka cooning ya
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-51758-52269 ikan mined fish in my way ya so cooning is uh is a
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-52316-52860 type of fish ya it it it is i think it's around like this this bake so
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-52924-53952 usually they they fry it with like temeric or something so so they it will look a bit like yellowy orangey ya but but it's really tasty because er
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-54000-54894 ya his hip deep right ya ya ya and and the good thing about nasiak also is uh because it it comes with
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-54932-55120 sambal which is chilli
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-55162-56346 ya and and the chilli is like a there's a tinge of sweetness to it so you you mix it around with the you can mix it around with the ingredients with the rice it it taste good ah and and they end it off with
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-56377-57105 cucumber so after you feeling wah really spicy and hot i you can just eat the cucumber to cool yourself down ah
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-57105-57248 ya
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-57248-57524 ya ya i i eat that often
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-58146-58441 oh noodles okay uh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-58514-58664 let's see
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-58900-59419 me boost can can also be a good choice because uh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-59560-59845 it's it's just yellow noodles u
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-59872-62479 cooked in like i think in uh some kind of like sweet sauce ah they they i no i'm sorry they cook the noodles first and then i think they pour that sweet sauce thing over ya i i last time when i was i was young ah i used to drink the sauce together ya it it's very like savoury but kind of fattening also at the same time ah ya and you usually uh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-62611-62839 mebus they they have
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-62950-63201 if i'm not wrong they have like a
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-63226-63927 hard boy eggche it's like oh ya i i forgot to say nas lem also has egg but but but it's fried egg ya
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-63958-65086 ya uh for me growing is boil egg because i think it is not really a suitable to have fried egg in a soy soopy dish ya
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-65148-66229 so they'll they will have like u boy egg and i think some some chicken in inside if i'm not wrong and they have like those like tao pork small small
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-66286-66392 the
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-66471-67215 ya and and and they have like i think they put some vggies like i think is it koreander or or something ya
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-67355-67771 the the the veggies i add a bit of crunch
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-67834-68271 to the noodles and then add a bit of like refreshing taste also
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-68355-68679 ya ya
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-69578-70052 okay uh indian food uh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-70245-70421 well uh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-70640-71650 i think uh nasi briryani you know uh it is a nice uh indian food because i i eat that quite often
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-71866-72807 the the they have the same around the same name as uh malay food like nasi briani i'm not sure why that's the case but
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-72837-73058 it's indian food ya so
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-73269-74428 the rise that they use is different from the the normal rice in nas they use u pasmati rice i think ya so it the grains of basmati rice they are quite long
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-74533-75168 so they they look very unique ah they the the first time the first time when i saw them saw it i thought it was
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-75257-75445 like uh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-75789-76652 how to say meam or or ya ya that was cut up really fine meam is is a kind of like rice very me selly that ya ya
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-76862-77678 it is rice that and they usually accompany with uh curry chicken
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-77772-78690 and if some some people they don't really like curry chicken so they they can like have have the option of like fried chicken ya but but the thing is the
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-78755-79098 the chicken is so big ya especially when
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-79147-79410 when you have the drumstick
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-79449-79661 ya the drumtick is like so big
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-79811-80603 every time i i save it for the last you know i i slowly eat the rice because uh other than chicken they they have it with uh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-80662-81096 sometimes they give you a piece of cracker ya uh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-81141-81334 is is a
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-81565-82575 i don't know what's that called but but that cracker has like some spices in it so when we eat the cracker you know there's crunchy and then there's some spice taste inside ya
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-82637-83112 so i usually eat the rice with the cracker then they have like some
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-83314-84037 salad ah how i put it salad ya some cucumber maybe some onions and all that
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-84082-84456 so nasi briyani is the rice itself is quite
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-84685-85067 tasty already but so you you can actually eat it on its own because they
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-85102-86041 they cook it with spices and and some other seasoning i i remember like i seen some kind of seed inside but i don't know what is it called
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-86101-86661 i think i saw star star annise ya kind of like herb inside also so
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-86794-87247 some herbs and spices so the rice itself has quite a nice taste
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-89177-89367 alright uh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-89388-89864 okay i might not know all of them so i i'll try to like explain everything
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-89898-90622 okay eleven b uh ya is is a national service lingo basically eleven b is a
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-90657-91597 identity card for all the full time national servicemen who who do their national service as you know all male singapore
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-91627-92761 ya their national service so they'll be exchanging their identity cards with this particular uh card by itself which identifies them as national service man ah
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-93081-93351 ya four d uh basically is uh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-93468-93875 it's a kind of a betting a system in singapore
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-93904-94592 it it just means four digits i think because people usually line up at the the betting uh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-94625-95276 betting place and then they usually place their pets on like four numbers that that will open and every
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-95313-96603 wednesday saturday and sunday ya i i don't do that but i have like relatives who do that often so ya ya and five cs ah is uh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-96729-97331 is a local like slang for the five cs that
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-97405-98177 or a guy usually they they they refer to a guy ah who must have it in order to be successful or or to

S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-98835-99040 ya ya a car
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-99066-99371 ya car is really expensive in singapore condominium
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-99404-99613 cash credit card
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-99652-99882 and country club membership
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-00456-01049 oh i'm way earned and i'm studying in chemistry and biological chemistry
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-01085-01208 currently year three
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-01664-02226 ah yes is my first choice because i used to study chemistry in singapore poly
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-02228-02478 ya so i continue on with the
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-02487-02599 same
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-02605-02861 same study aiya same course
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-03209-03438 uh yes i
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-03488-03959 mm because partly is i'm not interested in other fields
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-03969-04648 ya like engineering business so i more interested tend towards the science field ya so i chose chemistry
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-04885-05526 um because i don't like physics ya from secondary school i knew i don't like physics and bio is
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-05538-05794 um actually okay but
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-05827-06058 because chemistry is actually a mixture of
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-06155-06267 both of it
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-06392-06655 ya so i think chemistry is a
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-06736-06991 is preferred lah compared to those
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-07867-08175 subjects or modules ah um
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-08206-08326 okay so
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-08354-08744 uh in chemistry right we have a lot of different
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-08766-09248 uh we will never down to different concentrations like let's say food chemistry
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-09252-09448 um environmental
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-09470-10102 uh medicineal ya chemistry so currently i more interested in food chemistry
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-10129-10953 ya so that's why i'm taking a concentration in food chemistry as part ya so we'll be taking more food modules
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-101544-102284 in may sixty eight or something we we went for the early bird price so it's sixty eight for half marathon
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-102298-102669 ya and now i think is eighty plus or something already ya
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-102703-103008 ya ya ya the early bird thing ya
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-103133-103429 twenty one k m oh for half marathon

S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-12858-13611 okay like for example you know for milk right like let's say uh they will detect whether there are any toxic substances ya so it's partly
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-13632-13781 in this kind of field
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-14315-14577 um fun facts ah

S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-16230-16640 okay i currently cannot think of any ya
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-16981-17159 mm
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-17203-17492 you mean uh for food chemistry it ha
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-17623-17775 anything ah

S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-18028-18499 um or or probably cows have nice stomachs
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-19010-19660 um like for the or for the cows and nice stomachs because they will need to store their
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-19667-20065 food and then ya something something behind the
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-20211-21379 um okay i kind of forgot already ya so ya so the main thing is that they have nice stomachs lor as compared to others cause nice stomachs is actually a big thing to ya to us ya something like that
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-21713-22183 uh i'm not sure ya i i'm not sure about the birds thing ah
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-22205-22331 ya
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-22554-22725 ah ah ya ya ya
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-23051-23517 mm i'm in the welfare service club
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-23522-24205 ya so uh for the past two years i've been in the ormentation camp
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-24227-24602 like let's say you organise audition camps for the freshies ya
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-24609-25438 and ya that's for year one year two so currently i'm in the another portfolio of that c c a
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-25471-26282 ya which is kind which is called growth and opportunities ya but so this one is more towards um
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-26283-26600 uh uh canvassing
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-26604-27387 and finding sponsorships for the c c a ya like exam welfare packs and all ya ya ya those kind
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-27411-27689 ya so it's not much towards the
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-27704-27874 volunteering side
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-27885-28185 ya it's more of the uh
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-28310-28764 like emailing up to companies for sponsorships and everything ya ya
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-28907-29151 um actually normally is
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-29173-29825 it's easy to find sponsors it's just that uh which kind of sponsor is good
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-29835-30214 uh as in it's hard to find those good sponsors but it's easy to find sponsors
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-30218-30335 ah ya
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-30677-31219 oh cause we have we actually have a template so we just send ya so we just make sure that
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-31223-31545 um like you make sure that the company is
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-31583-32273 the company that you send to right the name is correct ah the email and everything ya then that will be okay ya
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-32706-33276 um oh besides that we have for like social impact week
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-33287-33580 ya social impact week so basically it's about
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-33582-35862 um okay so let's say different portfolios right they'll be in no spine so they will be showing off showcasing of their c c a ya so basically because this kind of events right we will need to attract people so to attract people you' need to have food ya u as in you need have free stuff ya so so that's why you' need to uh we'll need to try to find those um
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-35885-36858 like maybe candy floors or popcorn or whatever ya so or bubble tea ya so best if we can find sponsors for them so we don't need to take up money from our own pocket
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-36865-37778 ya otherwise if no choice right then we might have to uh like let's say use our funds ya to ask them to come over ya
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-38129-38960 um ya u or okay u that time they had bands and jerry's or something ah ya bens and jerry's ice cream or something ya
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-39010-39148 ya
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-39365-40300 ya back in jerry's and what else ah um oh and sometimes we have those free drinks ah those free isotonic drinks ya those sponsors ah those kind and all
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-40963-41169 ah ya ya something like that ya
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-41321-41961 uh not not really okay because they actually had a lot of portfolios right like let's say they had
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-41966-42547 uh true uh the friends or children the elderly um
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-42581-42974 and those physically disabled people ya so
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-43005-43122 uh
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-43210-43788 um but for that time for the first two years right i'm in the camp part
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-43831-44223 ya so i didn't really interact with the
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-44228-44600 people from different portfolios ya but if i were to choose
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-44608-45331 uh currently if i were to choose one portfolio it might be for the um for the kids one
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-45365-45480 ya ya
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-45796-46252 um hobbies i do i do baking so
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-46257-46407 um like
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-46444-47881 maybe brownies those very simple kind not those very uh you know not those very atas or not those ya ya ya ya i'm not those very nice looking all those birthday cakes that you see on instagram ah ya it's not those kind ya
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-47950-48661 ya so i do brownies and um maybe cheesecakes banana cake ya foodcakes ah
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-48710-49251 uh no but that time my friend as in for birthdays right they
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-49260-49889 um that time they ask me to bake like brownies for them then cause it's
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-49893-50188 my friend's friend then she insist to pay
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-50201-50635 ya then okay lor then okay lor then i accept the thing ah ya like that
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-50733-51383 ya no ya but i didn't as in cause i saw online a lot of people they are selling
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-51407-51859 in carousell like those brownies and all ya so maybe i might
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-51896-52101 in the future if i'm free
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-52108-52227 ya
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-52532-52882 ya ya it's actually quite busy for me especially this semester
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-52891-53267 because i overloaded my modules
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-53278-53472 ya because uh
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-53495-54782 um because i'm going exchange next sem so that's why i will need to overload like one more mod for this one ya so currently the quite a lot of modules lor compared to the last few sems ya
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-54891-55011 sweden
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-55055-55216 ya
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-55245-55546 okay actually sweden particular because um
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-55555-56525 i thought that i could clear a business g p over there in that university but ended up they rejected the thing although they had previous records of
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-56536-58291 um you can match that bis mod ya but this year they couldn't so that's why i um and when they rejected the application right i was already accepted in the jam sweden thing ya so i have no choice lor so i just oh okay because other than that i'm okay with any other unis in europe
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-58685-59339 ya a business shopee and also another of my uh year four mod ya so quite a lot of the mods
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-59854-60429 it's because of that ya and i didn't know china will be so expensive actually initially so
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-60490-61385 i went to google right it's like among like the top top five or something because switzerland is the most expensive one then followed by norway
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-61396-61638 ya then along like sweden like that ya
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-61732-61862 north europe
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-61921-62042 ya then
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-62059-63074 um i'm i'm i'm also fine with other europe places like let's say u k and all those ya but in the end like because of that module the business module that's why i chose sweden
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-63091-64040 but also i think partly because actually still okay because my senior was in sweden last semester then she said okay sweden swedish people very nice
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-64079-64392 ya so okay lor at at least ya
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-64811-65581 um i don't know i think a lot of things that i didn't experience before like maybe let's say uh
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-65618-65864 okay because i've never been to um
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-65900-66067 countries outside asia
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-66078-67465 ya and ya so i i didn't have the chance to experience winter as well then i heard from my friends that sweden right can go down to the temperature can go down negative something like fifteen or something
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-67488-68541 ya then i'm a bit scared lah because because uh i then i experience winter before then ya then the first time i go there then it came down in know like the this kind of temperature so i'm not sure where i can
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-68578-69392 debt to it that's why i told my friends oh i'll be you know like wet myself in a dumpling those kind ya
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-69757-70716 ya i don't think i uh i don't know because sixteen all those fourteen right i'm already like shivery and all those but but i didn't wear those clothes ah so i'm not sure
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-70726-70950 ya
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-71194-71612 um next semester so it's
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-71658-72436 the school starts in end august so i'll probably be going off maybe early august but we haven't plan anything yet
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-72481-73114 ya because ya because we haven't went in like we wanted to go for a pre trip at all ya so
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-73145-74069 ah yes yes ya like we were planning to go to like iceland or something like many people they plan to go like iceland and road trip or something
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-74100-74400 ya ya ya it's super expensive
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-74446-75027 i guess it will be because many people they go iceland cause it's very near each is ya it's very near
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-75385-76046 eh no as in sweden to iceland i think like can drive or something ya or as in for iceland you have to drive ah
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-76084-77082 ya but people they say cause at that point in time right it's very cool like let's say the it's ice so my friends that time say it's very very dangerous because you have to go up
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-77084-77865 ya then it's very dangerous then cause you have to go up and lo then that time their car i think their their car went on patol or something then they was trended
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-77892-78681 ya so then they have to call the person the emergency thing ya some more at the top of the mountain you know ya so
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-78760-79181 ya that's why then they they called the person then i think the person
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-79217-79631 like put the car or something like when ya
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-79640-79841 help to repair the car or something
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-80203-81344 ya ya that's right it's very dangerous ya especially when the work is sleep ya i will still go the the road is very sleepy ya cause with ice and everything ya
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-81552-81746 um
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-81752-81995 i think uh u k
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-82017-82243 ya u k and
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-82282-82542 not very sure maybe italy or something
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-82560-83975 ya haven't planned anything yet ya and and i'm not familiar with the place with all those countries cause i never been there before so i'm not sure ya probably i'll ask my friends for itinerary ah the itinerary ya
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-83997-84673 no as as in a few of them uh as in like seniors and all ya so they went there before ya
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-84709-84820 ya
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-85043-85707 um initially we have quite a lot eh no i said in uh initially we have maybe like six seven
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-85712-86839 ya but ended up cause that uni right we only had four places ya so um three of us went in then the rest they uh one went to korea
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-86853-87349 ya then some of them i think some of them went norway
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-87504-87623 ya ya
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-87735-88036 i think norway and sweden quite near each other
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-88042-88202 ya then
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-88226-88577 ya then for u k is
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-88579-88997 ya then for u k is another ya the other side already ya
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-89256-89456 um ya ya two other friends right
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-89751-91830 i'm not idea who the stranger is u ya that's why so we we still don't know who is the one that's going to that uni cause cause there are many um placing in sweden university so uh so um uh i friends who are going to sweden as well but but not going to the same university as me
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-91846-92807 ya so uh for my uni only have four placings lo that's why a bit a bit sad lah for ya for other unis i think they have like twenty or something
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-92826-92938 ya they have a lot
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-92938-93062 the
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-93062-93316 ah ah ya ya ya
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-93563-94570 ya ya uh maybe i would have changed to like maybe u k or something i i don't know ya cause at least ya because at least u k
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-94574-94907 like more people are going to u k compared to sweden
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-94928-95085 ya that's why ya
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-95103-95873 ya but okay i never mind lor at least my senior say swedish people are nice ya cause i heard of my
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-95926-96802 another friend right who went lastmester last year or something lah then she had a bad experience in u k like she said all the the u k people and all then ya i don't know
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-96934-97632 like she said they were very rude and unfriendly ya so ya i think it depends on the people that you met
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-97979-98223 ya ya it really depends on your
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-98256-98470 ya
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-99101-99213 baking

S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-05052-05603 ya so just hanging out at the liham library to study my
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-05624-05822 my stuff ya
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-06016-06138 yes
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-06364-06670 quite little like i i feel it's quite little
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-06689-07198 but uh i feel that also because like my first two weeks it was like i was in a holiday mood
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-07211-07590 then it's like ah i just don't i just really don't feel like doing work so i just
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-07645-08033 ya so so i'm trying to catch up what what was left in week one and week two
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-08058-08503 so um shouldly speaking week three isn't a lot la as of now ya
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-08948-09180 right now i'm in uh computer science
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-09190-09500 year one this is my semester two
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-09518-09867 so um still learning the ropes about
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-09892-10660 starting to learn how to program know more about uh the math behind computers and stuff like that
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-100230-100762 but but but the thing is that the funny thing is that you know like before i cannot come to uni i'll be like
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-100777-101737 okay lah i probably can notice the difference between the age you know like uh this person younger lah this person older but i think when you come to you it just doesn't think much about it
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-101883-102340 don't notice at all right you won't ah this person actually older than me
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-102444-102766 sad
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-103404-103552 army ah
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-103631-103764 i don't think it was
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-103792-104232 okay i think the the purpose of army is definitely necessary lah but
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-104234-104732 i don't i don't feel like i have went through a positive change afterwards like
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-104739-105301 like i i think it's like when in army you see a lot of those the ugly side of humans you know it's like
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-105382-105552 you get a bit like
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-105573-106088 some people you don't feel you do just don't trust ah like i i feel lah like in terms of
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-106225-106568 mm like there are a bit of like a backstabbing here and there you know
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-106586-107204 ya some politics here and then it's like you it's like it's so different from school school is like or i'm friends with you because
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-10683-10909 so quite
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-107300-107523 like we are just friends you know what i mean like but
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-107558-108553 in army ah i'm friends with you ah because mm you can do this you can do that ya i mean like or like i actually need you to do me do this somehow so it's like
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-108565-108988 i don't know lah i feel that the the relationship there is very hard
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-108999-109328 but eventually you will get it lah just sticks
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-109330-109773 some detours here and there like oh this person can lah never mind next one you lor that kind of thing
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-10950-11686 something that i am quite interested in ah because before that i i didn't know what i want when i first graduated from j c
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-109809-110082 ya but army was generally
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-110246-110394 uh
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-110508-110633 how do i say ah
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-110831-111034 sometimes quite quite entertaining
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-111043-111325 but when you look back actually it felt like you have wasted the time
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-111350-111734 like in a way lah in a way like because like um
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-111842-112029 there are a lot of times we have to wait
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-112152-113139 uh mine is a im am a tank operator so uh it's like we only have that amount of tanks and there's only that amount of tanks that go out so it's like very often we have to wait
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-113159-113599 so it's like the amount of wait time ah was actually very wasted like
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-113629-113945 and they will rush us to wait like it's like it's the army thing ah eh
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-113956-114284 this time then you must reach earlier you know it's a good practice but
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-114288-114640 there are sometimes that it was way too early or like you know
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-114658-115057 when you know leh you go there you still have to wait one it's not like going to start immediately that kind of thing
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-115064-115642 ya but it's like that that amount of time was quite wasted lah i feel but um
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-115649-115843 i can't really describe army much
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-115885-117543 like there are fond memories and afterwards it come out from army you have a lot of funny stories like or weird people inside like e go to okay before you go for me lah i not go to army i never thought that there will be weird people like people weird behaviour not that they are different or what but they just behave differently
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-11691-11905 so um
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-117564-117664 then
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-117713-118329 it's like maybe for me i don't see that in my j c and my secondary school then why i go to
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-118358-120558 army right then you will see those weird people and know some people that may not be weird but they are very weak minded like small thing they will be aya cannot do lah i don't want do already then they will drop out then they will find excuses then the thing is that i don't like about them is that ah e and they do that ah it's making more work for people because it's like the amount of work is meant to be divided among that that that number of people which was intended like they plan it
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-12008-12449 what i did is that um when i first got up when i first got result i was so nervous i was like
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-120588-120768 the the high ups planet
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-120771-121432 but when the when those that came in they drop out here and then here and there wah the boatload will keep keep increasing like that so it's like
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-121564-121675 ya
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-121690-122033 then also lah like sometimes i feel that
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-122058-122214 army wise
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-122216-122406 like the higher ups right
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-122447-123725 i don't know why it's like they will be like sometimes it's like you you you done what was necessary what's in the plan training then they will be like wa you do too fast ah you be free let me think of what i can give you to do so it's like
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-123750-123892 you do things
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-123946-124194 so that you are occupied you get what i mean like
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-124208-124456 i'm sure we have better things to do lah like
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-124458-125004 ya then it's like they will make us go clean the vehicle she then it's like oh okay
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-12455-13510 i don't know to go don't know where to go so i just applied for n u s science then uh in year two i thought m how about i try teaching you get what i mean so after i o r d i applied for teaching internship
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-125136-125293 that was not part of the plan
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-125299-125655 but because we do too fast we got penalised for it so it's like
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-125686-125803 oh
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-125969-126094 ya
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-13530-13976 then uh it was three months internship then after internship i realised that
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-13994-14881 teaching i interested but not being a teacher ya because being a teacher means much more than teaching itself like there are a lot of
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-14987-15716 ya you have the account to a lot of people like you have to account to the for the student account for the your high ups account to the parents
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-15725-16003 it it distracts you from teaching ah i feel so
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-16028-16449 i i i thought that okay lah then try computer science ya so i was quite glad
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-17108-17392 no i didn't take any elective for this sem ah
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-17396-18011 cause last sem i overloaded then this sem i think there was this module that a lot of the seniors says
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-18027-18172 that is very difficult
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-18190-18750 so i think about it lah no point rushing i mean right now i'm still at the normal workload mah
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-18766-19211 so i can afford to for this sem my focus on the difficult one lah
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-19272-19374 ya
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-19949-20143 uh during the internship
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-20162-20662 um i was given opportunity to teach sec two n a
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-20828-21152 and also uh sec three express chemistry
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-21170-21880 so uh that was that during the three three months i was given a chance to teach them prepare lesson plans and prepare the notes
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-21885-22563 and actually conduct lessons with them with my mentor at the back to observe and also to give comments afterwards
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-22585-22975 then uh right now i'm actually still uh giving tuition
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-22986-23475 so uh it started like last year january or or last last year december
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-23479-24050 so you this student i was teaching uh he's a primary six student from uh what's that called

S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-32260-32630 so ya that one is not related to the school that i was teaching ah
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-32633-33009 ya that one is the the one that i taught was at diner secondary school
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-33517-33696 ah from secondary school right

S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-33932-34459 it's like you know they are saying hey don't have any contact but you know some sort of student will still at on instagram
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-34477-34602 got lah but
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-34631-34974 mm better i feel that never mindd i better not you know
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-35044-35161 ya like
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-35172-35518 i don't know i go like can't get through myself ah get what i mean
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-35585-35818 so never mind ah so i teach
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-35840-36013 that student is enough for me lah
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-36549-37128 i actually looking at it i just started looking for it ya at first that one uh the one i was searching
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-37135-37478 uh it was enough because like she wanted two times a week
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-37515-38748 then i was like okay lah two times a week it's already you know at my limit there i was like okay it's enough for me to get on my life but now she wants one times a week which is also alright so i thought okay never mind i just get another student
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-38800-39056 ya i can also get another type of experience mah
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-39074-39514 so right now i'm looking but uh take some time for tuition agency to find and
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-39528-40654 they were what they will do is that you register say what you want your preferences your region and then they uh your rates and everything then when the parents actually ask for assignments as in ask for tutors ah
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-40666-41131 they will actually classify and see okay this suits what you are looking for then they will send to you
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-41142-41526 like it must be suit you and also the uh
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-41536-42592 the family is at the client ah ya still waiting ya but meal tutor are very hard lah they all want like you know female tutor it today is safer lah i mean
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-42706-42807 ya
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-42851-43090 so it's okay lah see how
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-43163-43294 correct correct
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-43349-43668 i think same lah i mean younger and older also worse what right
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-43705-43829 ya
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-44273-45077 ya but i i mean if you are if you are parents you will probably want a female tutor over male tutor isn't it or is there no preference
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-45338-45802 doesn't really matter if his daughter then different lah
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-46235-46463 mm different generation ah different generation
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-47205-47393 ah ya correct that
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-47573-47815 ten plus years i suppose like
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-47866-48352 okay let's say ya i think around there lah not quite old lah correct lah like
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-48446-48678 mm mm mm
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-48707-49097 ya i i agree on that like
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-50244-50893 actually right i'm hoping that you know singapore actually focus more about uh programming part
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-50906-52382 like uh maybe i heard that j c has like programming stuff so if let's say they actually offer that in j c i wouldn't mind teaching j c kids cause j c kids is the the time span is more worth it you get what i mean like in terms of pay per hour
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-52423-53045 ya but the thing is that competing programming wise lah a lot of things can be found online
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-53110-53627 ya like kahan academy co academy all all those there's a lot of free stuff online so
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-53683-54174 um but depends ah some parents they still want people to talk to the kids you know so
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-54204-54311 see how it goes
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-54936-55122 school
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-55228-55929 really hard lah but i hope lah i hope they will they will focus more on that i mean since they they say that they want more computer science people then
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-55951-56091 it'll help lah i mean
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-56108-56382 right now is an like when i join this course
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-56390-56748 uh my friend also say eh you are you are putting yourself at disadvantage because
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-56753-57309 uh my coursemates right some of them are from j c but a lot of them are from poly
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-57321-57985 then those people from polyte of course their course that they study was somewhat related to programming lah otherwise they wouldn't be here
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-57990-58214 so uh ya quite good
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-58222-58330 but
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-58335-58492 see how it goes ah
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-59001-60222 ya for for university specific wise ah i feel they get exemption leh then it's like wah we overlook ah don't know what la they still like eh take about take their time cause they got a lot of exemption
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-60491-60646 oh really
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-61004-61366 that that means they actually didn't waste their time you know i mean like
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-61541-61747 still even now what like you know
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-61850-62000 ya let's i mean
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-62026-62210 but it's not easy lah because
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-62216-62438 to get from poly to here
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-62441-62566 they are very good
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-62572-62685 they are very good
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-63008-63188 so what course i in like

S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-94036-94232 from like graduated from
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-94282-94394 huh so
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-94477-94579 ya
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-94628-94997 it's quite sad i mean i i came out from army right then i was like okay
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-95035-95322 then i went to this course then i saw my friend

S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-96275-96422 wah sad
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-96559-96719 it's so sad like wah
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-96899-97046 what to do
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-97468-97573 uni ah
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-97758-98173 but you won't notice the age range right
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-98462-98578 your dad oh
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-98924-99027 uh huh
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-99248-99825 i i think for your kid is more of the older spectrum right like you this person so much older
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-02871-03039 is it are you asking right now
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-03349-03549 to get from north point to high
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-03582-04227 okay right now we are at b four of common science blog so what you can do is that you just take a lift
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-04250-04478 up to the first floor
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-04544-04724 then um
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-04834-05511 walk out of this block itself then when you walk off this block it turn left and walk straight all the way
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-05526-05845 you will soon see a nanyang auditorium or
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-05880-06300 a coffee bean i think at that point of time it's very easy for you to ask someone else there
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-06309-06462 then um
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-06612-06908 to get to the hive um
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-06975-07261 you can just pass by the starbucks
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-07336-07637 and walk down a a a long flight of stairs
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-07694-08033 then uh walk straight you will eventually sing a lecture hall
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-08052-08357 i think it's a what i can't remember the name
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-08440-09097 but that lecture area is very iconic like it has big panels of glass
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-09120-09555 okay so that that is very iconic so uh so when you see the
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-09580-09769 um lecture right
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-09789-10422 you just turn right you will see a staircase that leads down so you just go down the staircase
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-100204-100352 oh my god
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-103745-103928 mm what singapore's do ah
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-104071-104370 oh singapore'
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-104383-104647 the first thing they see a queue they will queue
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-104651-105104 they won't ask sir what are you queuing for they won't ask is he a queue
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-10473-10696 then afterwards you go down the staircase
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-105123-105757 the first thing that comes to my mind is not to us is that mm there must be free and good stuff
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-105778-105975 cause that's singapore'
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-106021-106558 okay so it's like they will just kill q q then at the end of when they reach the start of the queue ah they'll be like
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-106572-106818 uh sorry ah what what are we queuing for ah
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-106824-106982 then they will get what they want
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-106983-107532 mm then they will live satisfied but sometimes they they will be a bit angry ah because they cute for nothing but they deserve it
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-10717-10874 um
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-107542-108347 so um they also like to some some weird behaviour that singaporeans do is that they also like to use um their own singlish
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-108398-108601 so um
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-108845-109018 as you grow up
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-10900-11028 make a u turn

S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-124984-125157 aqua means
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-125318-125790 a bit sensitive let's not talk about it because we are conservative then um
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-12566-13206 walking forward when by the time you reach the lower floor of kofu i think it will be u c

S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-129015-129121 i i think
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-129133-129383 so uh g g
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-129439-129991 depends on the context they are saying g g if you say in a game it means good game
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-130169-130516 if you say to others that did something wrong
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-130530-130786 eh you g g already it means that
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-130831-131070 good game also good game but
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-131106-131289 in a way it means that
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-131297-131428 um

S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-132313-132582 it can also be interpreted i'm gonna go home
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-13233-13444 uh you know the team sum
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-132849-133011 it depends on the context
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-133076-133206 uh
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-133579-133780 then um
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-133886-134104 okay then also shag

S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-28237-28377 ya that's why what ah
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-28402-28627 i think i had some seafood one scallop

S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-30035-30163 but the place very
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-30856-31136 i assume that you will be going from hive
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-31174-31483 so uh opposite hive there's uh there's a bus stop
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-31552-31893 um opposite in the direction of the koufu lah
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-31901-32027 so you will see a bus stop
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-32042-32505 then uh what you can do is that you can actually take a bus one seven nine
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-32564-32937 and uh alight at the last stop because it will stop at the
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-32993-33169 boon layy bus in the change
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-33200-33649 so when you alive from nat inter change you are actually at jurong port already
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-33655-35013 so just find a way uh for for the japanese food that i said just now as i said is actually at the basement the the the bottom basement is u at this japanese street so you go through that straight everything is japanese food
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-35050-35321 japanese food is the best so um
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-35349-36180 then for the one that i told you about that one is don't know how to describe but i will assume that that was around like the second last floor
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-36239-36500 ya it's beside the ah ku
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-37750-37872 shopping ah
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-38114-38240 what do you want to shop for
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-38449-38549 oh
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-38773-39553 hm honestly i don't recommend though uh but uh i think boon lay is good enough honestly like they have quite a number of
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-39675-40147 close but but if you are willing to go further go to like suntec harfront
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-40166-41385 ahh i mean vivo city lah harbofront those are the bigger malls uh if you want to streetwe go bugis street or some place you can place that you can go is at the tanjong place called ah
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-41543-42215 i can't remember what's that place city plaza is it i think cit plaza but what i know is that that plaza has are not chicken
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-42254-42780 if you know that ah then ya that one actually sell quite a number of there are i think they're retailers
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-42827-43202 and they sell mostly female clothes so ya i think it'll be quite suitable for you
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-43896-44221 uh bo lay one i i assume already know
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-44224-44614 so uh to get to the
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-44642-44819 bugis sri is
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-44824-45319 just take uh the green line in your case from boon lay all the way to bugis
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-45346-45680 or if you want to go suntec you can also take a bus from
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-45837-46824 to sunteck straight away or can walk from there if you want i mean it's very near then uh you want to go harfront err you probably have two
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-46906-47593 stick to the bud boa vista and then just stick the line straight down to harboorfront is the last station
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-47657-47913 ya i think that's reasonably close lah so
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-48341-48987 tanjong baga tanjong baga is um is a little bit be it's a few stations before
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-49002-49904 um bugis so from boon lay to tanjong ma is nearer than going to bugis because the tanjong mag in between tan boon lay and
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-51040-51155 i don't drink eh

S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-01929-02417 uh i'm having a class um right before this um session
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-02432-02647 so i was at uh
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-02673-02858 uh self spine
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-02986-03222 having my accounting lesson
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-03408-03611 um an accountancy
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-03914-04072 a year two sem two
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-04487-04922 um yes it is my first choice because um
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-04932-05634 when i was in poly i was doing business admin so it's quite a general um course
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-05643-06076 so from there i start to realise like what i actually like
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-06094-07197 because i tend to get to try different areas of business so after trying i realis realise that eh financial accounting is something i like because it is very um
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-07209-07323 clear like
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-07373-07861 once you get it you get it you know unlike the rest of the module like um
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-07890-09213 a bit fluff i feel so i was like eh is this correct or is this wrong very subjective so i thought that uh accounting is what i want so when i was here in uni year one i realised that err is a bit
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-09229-09463 different from what i expected
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-09490-09602 so ya
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-09715-09906 uh how is it different
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-09992-10301 what island is way too in depth already
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-100007-100744 what we do in poly also but not that difficult but ya we also did like a lot of practice like you know all the things
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-100848-100976 so ya
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-101641-101971 i prefer working just that that experience is like
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-101999-102217 ya totally different
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-102244-102806 but the thing about that i i what makes me um decide to
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-102822-103684 um go on to financing uh to accounting now is also because i feel that after that three years in poly i didn't really learn much is
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-10345-10770 too much calculation and ya that's all that
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-103709-103972 the at that time i remember uh year three
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-103997-104788 uh before we like um decided where we want to go like either work or continue applying for uni um
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-104800-105274 uni so we were sitting down in a group then we were like err okay
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-105306-105613 so what we actually learn from this whole
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-105655-106449 whole um poly education then we were like don't know e i think do nice presentation so we don't have like really a very
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-106473-106672 confident answer like oh
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-106680-107263 our sta is okay we learn statistic so okay we can use that or excel is very good no
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-107265-107779 that skills part a bit we have no idea what to put there also
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-107781-108902 so this is what makes me like think that i need to go on to something that u is more specialised so that i know that after i graduate know okay this is
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-109016-109200 ya
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-109948-110496 that time i was like sixteen seventeen so i know i want to do into this like
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-110617-110933 the general more general course
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-110960-111233 like you don't have to make decision on like
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-111273-111783 where to go or what we want to do so we can get to try different stuff
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-112186-112648 ah ya i didn't want to make a choice then
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-112774-113781 if now i were to go back to that time or advise another person at my age i think it's good to
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-113865-113983 think through it
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-114047-114183 because at the end
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-114195-115290 you unless you really know that oh you like marketing you like all these to learn all these skills then you feel that it's very uh subjective ah some people feel it's good because it force you to
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-11431-12449 even though i have a lot lots of complain about this but i still love it lah like i can see myself doing it um after i graduate
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-115314-115425 be more
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-115431-116821 uh there's a lot of presentation for my cause so we tend to work with different groups so we are very used to like working with different people uh for every sem and every mo we work with different people so
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-116854-117555 even if changing environment or what it doesn't really affect us we can like adapt easily so i think this is one of the takeaway from by
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-117561-117881 cause other than that i think
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-118182-118342 yes yes
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-12477-14352 because uh after i graduate i tend i plan to continue in this industry and also continue to see how i can improve myself in that area like see what i'm lacking in like the skills or what i'm lacking so i can continue to upgrade myself even after i graduate
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-15129-16072 uh i don't really have a club that i join but uh i tend to take up like classes outside like previously during um
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-16124-16306 my summer break
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-16337-17034 before that uh before this sem i was actually doing my uh internship i took an l o a so
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-17040-18421 while i was working um from nine to six like during the weekend and after work i tend to have a lot extra time because unlike school we don't have to like uh bring work back home to do or what so i have more time so
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-18428-18908 that's the time where i start to like um learn more about other things like
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-18941-19042 uh
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-19044-19160 insurance
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-19173-21272 i go for classes like to see like how come there's so many people so interested in this industry so i go for their classes which is like um you don't have to pay for anything but you just go for the lesson to have a few to understand more about what people are actually talking about so that's what i tend to spend during my leg
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-21890-22983 at the start because it is six month um internship it is my first time working for so long so at the start i still very feel very you know i enjoy and like you know um
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-22989-23324 because t g i f is really t g i i f
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-23358-23622 ya then weekend you really like rest
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-23798-24727 um starting really after three months right you start to feel a bit nine to six is like too long already even if you got nothing because um
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-24744-26476 uh during working hours right you tend to have like sometime it's off peak hour so you have like u more time for yourself but you still have to start in that office you know you have like you cannot go anywhere you cannot keep visiting the pantry or the toilet so you still just have to sit there then you realise that
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-26552-26854 when you knock off that time it's already like
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-26869-27091 ah the sun already set
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-27120-28376 so you like you miss you really miss the sun you know like because in the morning like eight plus i will reach office then i think i will go out around twelve plus so that's the only time you will get to feel the sun
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-28931-29411 yes yes otherwise you are like trapped in that office like
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-29900-30042 yes yes yes
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-30097-31883 so right now is like even though you have lots of time lah because i arrange my timetable in a way that i only attend class in the morning i prefer morning class so after twelve plus i have my time like own time but you have to allocate time to your revision and all those catching up with the assignment all those
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-32573-34306 okay like for the class because um like for one module i will only attend like they make it in a way like we only attend class for three hours in a week ya so lesser time lesser class uh seminar but more readings ah they have more time ya
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-34313-34637 to do reading have own own edit ah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-36257-36525 no i take like forensic science
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-36575-36676 oh
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-36713-36960 interesting i don't think
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-37042-38047 it is interesting because you tend to learn way more than what you can absorb so at the end of the class you feel that oh you are overwhelmed by all the information
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-38281-39105 what i find it interesting is after finals then ya you start to record back what you learn then okay eh still quite fun like
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-39131-39344 but during that um
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-39430-39987 semester itself you have lots of things to cope so you don't really feel like
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-40081-40439 ya ya
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-41423-41832 volunteer stuff i volunteered in c d a c

S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-42246-43381 place where we tend to help like uh teaching the primary school the um less fortunate primary school student like in tutoring them in their work or what so there's once
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-43389-44070 uh we actually have this you know every year we have this um at the start of the year we have this um seminar
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-44080-45613 prepared for secondary u poly student parent and and themselves ah the student themselves so what this seminar is about is that to prepare them on what poly life is about because um from secondary school to poly is a bit different
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-45616-46429 so we tend to like share with them what uh they will expect from this uh education
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-46447-46636 and you know um
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-46682-47687 ya to prepare themselves ah so i get the opportunity to um be the emcee for that seminar ya so i think that is the a very
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-47808-48015 memorable experience for me
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-48144-48380 dude mm
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-48751-48959 on and off on and off ya

S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-49560-49677 ya is
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-49699-49895 mm within my budget
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-49961-50351 but at the same time still can you know travel out of singapore
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-50388-50650 yes yes yes yes
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-51485-51697 i think is the people

S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-52619-52804 like they are always so
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-52865-53285 excited about something i don't know like you can feel that they're

S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-55632-56630 in thailand they will tend to i think its the way they speak or but their tone is very high so you feel that uh their energy level is so high then you feel you can feel their

S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-85829-85943 mm
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-86260-86374 ya
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-87785-88062 it depends eh like for me like

S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-88449-88770 but i tend to follow the majority
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-88795-89409 like depends on what people want to eat then i just okay i don't have a mm preference or what ya
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-89456-89574 no
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-91358-91636 poly mm i think poly
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-91776-92187 for my course right is different from i didn't know
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-92217-94390 this difference until i um graduate from polyte so this is what happened uh during poly uh for my course i'm doing business admin so we focus a lot a lot on like those marketing soft skills their presentation uh as compared to banking finance and accounting course they are more um
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-94408-96780 book related like you know uh they emphasise heavily on finals like their paper but for us is like u our a huge percentage is focused on our presentation so we our lecturer will keep telling us like you know the slides must be like u a lot of animation as dramatic as possible you know our presentation is like
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-96798-97382 we need to perform in class one to entertain like there's entertainment um
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-97527-97889 marks their component in that presentation so
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-97928-98248 i thought that you know i at school is poly is like that
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-98290-98655 ya so that's why that's why i was i keep saying that when
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-98673-98932 i entered uni the difference is like wah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-99005-100004 so different until i spoke to like um my uh accounting and banking finance um peers then they're like oh actually this is something
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-02876-05032 i think um nearby would be boon lay uh what's that ma actually i cannot remember but you can travel like um take u travel out from the school compound and take a train to boon lay station and alight otherwise you can alight at a jurong east also i think that will be an ideal place to shop because there are a few more shopping malls
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-05056-06154 ya oh i remember boon lay there is this jurong point but in jurong east there are i m m uh and a few mores over there which can visit
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-07448-07820 uh i think the more popular places that people know
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-07823-09113 where they sell fashion appar are in bugis area um a orchard there's this ury five is plaza otherwise the the other place you can visit is at this err
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-09157-09271 where's this place
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-09350-09548 uh the city plaza
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-09577-09776 ya so i think that is
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-09786-11442 because people know that uh that place is where uh no all the blockshop will get their supplies from they tend to sell u in huge quantity es so if say you want to buy something some clothes and huge quantity that is a very ideal place to get their clothes
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-100827-101633 so if we say um i don't like that lah give face a bit leh it means that you know don't embarrass the person
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-101645-101763 and like
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-101808-102603 don't point out her flaws or his flaws like in public places ya so this is what gift means
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-102883-103641 it's also very um it's something we use very frequently and it's very convenient like is it is it means that
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-103720-103849 is this true
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-103940-104714 uh ya so if when we want to i see if something is it real or authentic or what then we just say is it
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-104850-105297 and jialat is also a word that you will often
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-105329-105543 hear people using it
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-105583-105847 jialat is like oh no but
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-106007-106282 it make it sound make that situation
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-106314-106599 sound more worse than it is
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-106717-107441 so you can feel when someone use the word jialat you can feel you can you need to know you need to be aware that
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-107568-108528 the situation is like out of control that's why these words will appear and as you know a singapore
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-108571-109057 hec in a hectic lifestyle so we are always very kanjong
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-109144-109289 so this word
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-109333-110082 if you want to say like how you can also like include this in your question like why you always so kanjong
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-110175-110480 um maybe the way they speak
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-110501-110672 uh um
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-110742-111294 the way they do their stuff eat or they the way they finish their meal like it ya
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-111403-111555 and
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-111726-112034 uh other than that i think uh
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-112121-112283 chen chai is
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-112295-112401 when
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-112548-112725 will be used when
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-112782-112930 a person reach
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-112952-113563 his maximum capacity then they will be like aiya change chai lah whatever
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-113706-113842 so this is
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-113911-114093 um used when
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-114108-114382 be realize the situation is
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-114417-114690 too much to handle overwhelming
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-114756-114859 and
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-114874-115533 something which the student will often encounter in classes is that they catch no more
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-115631-115918 the um prof would be like
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-115922-116703 telling his stories or delivering his class while we are in our the student are in their own world
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-116736-117018 and not knowing what's going on
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-117045-117208 so ya
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-117225-117341 this is what
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-117351-117661 happen if the lesson is too chim
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-117839-117953 and
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-118057-118343 we will use the word chair when
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-118556-118774 okay this is what happen if
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-118817-119502 person a describe something you know very significant like we expect something huge from it
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-119522-119622 and
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-119629-120159 the reality is no it is not then we'll be like chair like that only
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-11997-12670 from bulay m r t you can travel all the way to towards um
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-120249-120458 it shows that we are very disappointed
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-12743-13233 changi uh that side uh so you alight at
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-13301-13497 eh let me take a look
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-13696-13838 oh okay

S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-15604-15779 so from

S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-23132-23407 it's better to travel by bus
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-23414-24137 so you can alight at uh yu chu kang station and take the bus there's a few bus you can take
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-24152-24557 once you reach that station so you can look at the
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-24588-24950 directory and see like where to alight
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-24985-25657 and ya i prefer um taking bus to
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-25672-26949 uh taking this train is because uh bus you get to see more things and you have more personal space as compared to train like in train you sit inside the train they are like facing
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-26962-28350 uh the opposite side of the people so sometimes you feel a bit uncomfortable so you tend to look either out of the window or on a at a phone but bus is different like you just everybody is facing the front
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-28377-28560 so ya more
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-28589-28695 privacy
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-29518-29708 mm other parts
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-29722-29983 i think pasir ris park is good
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-30077-30758 and once you at pasir ris not only there is this park you can also visit their
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-30772-31063 um facilities like the world war war
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-31152-31982 which just i think it just open and there are also other like um chalet for you to stay with your family and
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-31999-32216 have a barbecue session over there
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-32256-32435 so i think that is a very good
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-32639-33237 short get away from you know your daily life and to
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-33246-33619 have a gathering with your family or friends
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-34625-35062 i think nightlife for nightlife is also town near but i would think
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-35080-35445 actually um going to harbourfront sentosa is good
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-35481-35609 yes because
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-35617-36284 vivo cities huge like you can there's a lot of food for you to um visit it also then
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-36352-36517 uh other than that
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-36525-36668 once you like
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-36744-37953 out of the shopping mall you can like take a walk or buy cable car or drive into sentosa and you know have a different experience of that area also
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-38556-39156 you can travel all the way to uh using circle line to outram
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-39175-39920 then you alight and take the purple line and or you will reach there around like forty five minutes you will reach upperfront
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-39995-40808 so it's very convenient with the line on our transport system ya so you can reach any place you want
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-41603-42030 recently i just um ya as what i mentioned uh sentosa
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-42058-42209 because um
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-42409-42586 that is a very uh
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-42944-43196 i just went there because uh
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-43299-44064 of the clean beach and ya then we can have other activities over there also like the fountain the
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-45263-45910 i think as zoo um but i would prefer like you know that there's this um bugis plus there's this um
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-45935-46063 dog cafe
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-46103-46523 ya so i think that is the place that which i want to visit one day
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-46564-46845 because i haven't get to visit one
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-46884-48237 so i think that is also yes yes yes i animal cafe so you can go there and because as compared to zo zoo you just get to see the animal but for a dog cafe you can get to interact with the pets over there
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-48275-49243 and another place you can go is if you want to experience a more um kampong lifestyle you can visit a kranji

S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-94608-94968 we singapore
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-95656-96586 like um maybe the place is too warm and we want to increase the temperature of the aircon we won't say like air condition or what we just say aircon
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-96610-96815 ya and
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-96994-97445 if we got additional stuff or what then we will say like extra
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-97488-98060 so extra can mean a lot of thing like you are to describe a person
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-98070-98335 it means that that person is
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-98360-98791 not necessary to be here you know he or her present
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-98938-99272 redundant so we also um call that extra
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-99378-99617 and for um
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-99856-100812 so for asian culture we focus we emphasise a lot of uh give u this thing called give people face like give face

S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-03087-04160 because my a level result wasn't that good then i didn't have a goal in mind to choose what course also so it's like engineering in the safest path you know the options to broaden my options
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-04458-05356 um yup i do have a friend in mac graduated already he's in mac ah then he also advised me that if im not very sure just choose engineering

S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-111371-111704 so you get to do uh scuba diving
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-111709-112129 then snorkeling um banana boots
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-112186-112333 and
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-112343-112451 what is that called
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-112550-112786 uh a island hopping
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-112929-113038 is package
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-113090-114361 ya actually they do u it's not very hard to plan to gorari because once you reach there you go to the hotel area there are a lot of tour kind of small tour agencies there on the streets then they're publicised to you ya
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-11422-11527 okay
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-114485-115080 ya it's very common so you have to find the cheapest package you ask around ya
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-115307-117016 um not i mean it's become more of a very touristy place lah like they have their food is not other than thai food they have a lot of western food to cater to the westerners lah so you see a lot a lot of tourists over there instead of locals then the locals i think the locals in that area is
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-11542-12075 um actually i didn't come from a rich family i'm just come from i don't think i just maybe
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-117042-117834 uh mainly they do business for tourists lah to survive not really like the locals local if very
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-117876-118030 tourists oriented
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-118791-119065 mine is food and activities
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-119093-119541 so like the beach activity the sea activity is that attract the me most lah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-119545-120519 so i thought it's quite fun and veryreurous to try out all those because in singapore's their view is not very nice la singapore
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-120533-121031 then for food wise ya of course you have to try the authentic thailand food krabi
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-12085-12745 low middle income family lah so i don't my parents don't have much resources for me to engage tutors
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-121055-121722 so food and activities ah and most importantly is the company lah i think is your friends then make it fun
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-12750-14854 so i thought that it will be good for students to have additional tuition lah because now people are getting more affluent and the income gets widening so i don't think that it will be fair to have u it's like people is already in the front of you for quite a few steps already so want to try to level the unfair advantage lah the playing field for the students
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-15072-15411 oh actually is i i started this lah with my friend
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-15425-17631 ya so we thought that since we have the resources because as because at that time i was in army then nothing much to do as usual so i'm quite bored so i thought that why don't i use this time and help people lah so the only skills i i was i came from a j c so the only skills i have is more of academic wise lah so my my why not just make use of these skills to help people ya
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-18280-19066 um ya currently we do have around ten tutors with close to twenty students already so they do volunteer on a weekly basis lah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-20251-21364 um actually is part of our youth club projects so i actually our um main objective our youth club is to really interact with youths or help the residents in our constituency
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-21371-23793 so in part of our comedy service project we try to outreach the youth by organising this blood donation drive although we target mainly on youth but a not a lot of turn up lah but as usual a lot of donors which are from other constituency they came down and donate donated blood so because the blood donation drive to find out objective is to really get blood for those like uh those blood type that is lower level lah ya
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-24346-24807 it's quite interesting because we just started this hungry games last year
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-24811-26733 i think it's around may period so how these games come out we count how we come up with this game is because we thought that want to find something to attract youth then we thought that other than gaming then we thought the food is a very good thing to attract youth so we thought of uh gathering all the best food stores in yishun
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-26739-27126 and try to advertise it out as a programme so we do a thrill
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-27137-29093 then we give participants a group of participants four to five then give them some money then they go and visit all the stores and we do have stations in between to let them really understand more about the food so example they can eat a plate of char kway teow but they do' know about the history of cha k teo ingredients the cha kre the store owner use and stuff
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-29105-29862 so it's really more of to know more about food and to most importantly enjoy the food lah as a with their friends or families lah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-30224-31139 ya some some of course we will do more general one more general ingredient like the sauce the kind of go details how they make the sauce we will not we will skip that part it's more of the general part
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-31864-32856 um okay generally basketball is what i love lah then other sports i do um not really i think i do a bit of running and stuff
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-33141-33736 um not really i play recreational basketball until uni so i joined the hall team lah ya
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-33970-34227 um ya lah i'm still in the hot team
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-34403-34808 mm in uni not really more of hall activities
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-34984-35308 so i join uh productions for hall
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-35324-35869 so we acted out a play lah just ended i think is mid jan ah we perform a mid jan
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-35924-36314 the play was about the title of the play was forgotten
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-36342-36713 then uh it's about uh it narrates about a family
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-36715-37124 so they have uh the main character is the ah gong which has dementia
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-37140-38014 then when the family members don't want the i come to stay with them so they keep pushing the ahonng around so it's like a of the whole family
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-38019-38848 then in the end everyone in the end ahonng is ahcon is dead i throw a series of event then everyone start to feel that is
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-38855-39060 start to reflect about their actions lah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-39069-39613 so it's a more of in try to educate people about family values lah to play
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-39829-40261 um i'm he's i'm actually his son i'm called patrick
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-40269-42621 so i'm the i'm the olderest son but i'm not the oldest lah i have a older sister actually i'm okay to take my bar in just that my i have a wife which is very dominant then she don't like ah gong at all and my daughter also so i've kind of a hand packed husband so i have to listen to them so i'm more portraying that i'm i have i have no choice that kind of feeling
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-42632-43647 as a a son i try to be i try to be nice to my father but at the same time i have to face my wife and my daughter so it's kind of a struggle ah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-43741-43907 how eleven
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-44160-44282 i think
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-44300-44763 i heard only a few horse has productions because this is like a ad hoc committee
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-44769-46709 so it like depends on the hall culture so sometimes some people have the bike rarely they can't different kind of events lah so for our hall we have this productions ongoing so every year they will come together and set up one committee then during the december holidays will be very busy for us we rehearsing then put our performance on january
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-47157-47538 uh not really ya
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-47737-48186 uh not very faultage just my interest lor my passion acting
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-48399-50053 ya i do actually last time i started acting in secondary school i do chinese drama last time now the forgotten is in english so during this chinese drama journey i felt that it was quite fun and entertaining to do drama as an actor lah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-50069-51372 so i made a lot of friends a lot of good memories and so we went for s y f competition we went for public performance also so this kind of let me realise that i really like drama and acting
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-51376-52030 but in j c i didn't get to get a chance to act because i didn't join the drama in j c
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-52155-52779 um not really i just want to try different things ya but the passion came back during n s time lah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-52785-53263 so after n s that period i went to help out in a polytechnic final year project
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-53266-53413 so we do filming
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-53417-53758 so i'm like um helping it out as an actor also
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-53787-54198 then here and there i do ca fair for some commercial shoots also
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-54383-54692 ah no lah middle court pay is very low
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-54697-55154 so it's just those commercial like m o e ya they do have videos and stuff
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-55824-56416 i understand because for acting right um i will say that uh
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-56417-56766 i won't say that my passion is that strong enough to make it as a career lah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-56820-56991 so it's like more of a
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-56999-57167 pobby kind of thing
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-57199-57480 so i don't think that i will treat it very seriously
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-57496-58326 ya so if i decide to treat seriously lightly i will be coming to n t u lah i be going to the cell or anything lah some nafa the
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-58328-58458 acting school
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-60023-60149 okay so
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-60191-61000 um in chinese drama i feel that i am more comfortable in speaking in mother tongue because my family speaks mother tongue since i was young lah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-61007-61885 so i brought up in the mother tongue language so i feel that it's easier for me to relate my emotions using my mother tongue compared to english
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-61903-62044 and sometimes
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-62050-62229 english words are
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-62257-63096 i would say it's too straightforward that we can't really play with the words for chinese one character have a lot of meaning so we do can play with the character and words
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-63129-65226 for my experience in chinese ramen i feel that for secondary school is really my coach is very dependent on the coach and the teacher instead of student initiative for uni ho eleven productions we do very depend on dependent on the students although it's not very professional in a way but i think that that's how people grow lah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-65234-65768 we really do think on our own booking a value acting directing is their in is their
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-65827-67355 their baby are the ideal then they try different things although it's not um things some things that we have disagree have disagreement over with lah but i believe that is a very good experience for us to take initiative and lead the whole project
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-67525-67674 ya student production
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-68228-71316 actually last time i was very unhealthy and fat in secondary school then my although i didn't qualify for the taft club my teacher my b teacher recommend me to join the running club ah actually running club is full of athletes running long distance then just expanding so being the one of the um least competent runner my teacher encouraged me to proceed to carry on and running to start my running journey so i started from two point four click then move on to five click and ten click ah then slowly i slimm down and get better in running
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-71347-71862 then i start to join longer distance half marathon i think that's the furthest i ran ah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-71979-72247 so we do that normally
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-72282-72700 like i do running at one or around two twice per week lah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-72712-72898 do i try to keep myself fit
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-73315-73667 uh i think is standard chartered
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-73693-73856 standard chartered marathon
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-73866-74381 that that was the that was the one where i ran the tough marathon twenty one click
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-74929-75087 uh kind of lah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-75249-75923 uh because i do have another medical condition i have asthma so i join not in a combat fee unit
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-76250-76455 i was a air force technician
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-77107-77546 ya so they do send us to vocation school ah so it's the air force training school
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-77549-78679 then we learn for my role is i maintain radars lah so we do maintenance and inspection for radar like very weekly lah ya so they do have courses roughly i think it's one and a half month of courses
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-78941-79366 um you can say so is different ah different
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-80360-80463 okay
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-80569-81215 actually my vocation is quite slack lah so i do have a lot of spare time
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-81234-81641 during my n s i do a lot of thinking and sound reflection then
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-81652-82542 i thought and i try a lot of things during my free time i off day and stuff so i first one of the main thing i tried is to volunteer at my youth club
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-82560-82824 so i do a lot of projects over there
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-82837-83083 then another one is i tried out acting
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-83111-84333 so with my spare time like during although it's like kind of a moonlight thing but during my spare time i go to try acting at uh shoot production and shoots lah mm

S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-86747-87091 i think the best part is make a lot of friends there
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-87104-87872 yup ah i mean other than my n s air friends we also make a lot of regular friends lah which are very close with them also even after like o r d

S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-88552-88759 but i i think i
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-88816-89093 was closest with my regular friends
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-89117-89447 ya so they are still in army lah now in a unit
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-89806-90049 i think is to really
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-90077-90289 just listen to instructions ah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-90541-91370 ya it's like the chain of command is the nature of art military start lifestyle lah it i will say that you need some time to adapt to it lah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-91372-92036 whereas sometimes you have your own views you prefer things that way but it's in military ya you have to follow by the law lah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-93052-93298 mm dialect hokkien

S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-97257-98079 because like i think with dialect if you know your dialect well you can speak to more elderly i think it'll be great also ya
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-98358-98531 um
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-98581-99396 for elderly we do have projects also we but it is more of a ad hoc one we organise u like a music

S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-103302-105229 okay so actually we for this word is called blur right so when you call someone blur you will say that it's a mother head right so for blur we do have something we add on as blur like so tong so it like a catch phrasese so people say you blur then we will say blur like a sotong so it becomes a very frequently used phrase in our school
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-10448-10806 then you watch straight you should be you should be rich one s a c ya
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-105236-105823 so that's why it's quite singlish in a sense lah used well commonly used by singapore
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-106153-107022 okay so alaak is like um in i will say that in your uh in western country they will be like oh shit
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-107029-108291 ya so it's like oh my god you forgot something or you realise that something is not right so you suddenly eh oh a moment or like you suddenly think or something then you forgot to do and say oh shit so singapore
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-108606-111021 okay so for confirm plus chop um so the context is actually very funny so sometimes people say that um they ask you are you sure about this thing then people are confident so they will say confirm plus chop so that chop is more of like a stamp of warranty ya this is how they come so they it's just a link goes to saying that ya i'm very sure that this can be done
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-111301-111581 so this is called zao
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-111596-111825 z means it's just let's go
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-111832-112442 or you can or something that you can say in okay actually for zao is come from hokkien a dialect in singapore
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-112461-113483 so you can say that people zao already people run away already or you can say a more less extreme version people say z means that let's go something like that ya
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-113846-115742 steady okay so for steady right um in english terms is whether are you very firm or steady but in singapore context we use it as um are you um are you confirm are you are you willing to commit something like that so people say steady means that they are willing to commit to this thing
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-115998-118138 okay suau means that is like um relates to a chinese phrase so it's like people say that you are fra in the well lah so fraud and the well means that you when you look up you only can see the circle of sky so you are not aware of surroundings means you are not well informed you are not well educated about things so youwaaco means you are always in your own world and do a lot of things
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-11723-12210 okay for student health centre i think is called the fullerton health service
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-12230-13147 okay from there oh okay there's a few ways to go there number one you have to walk back to all the way to the hive there
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-13156-13312 then you have to walk

S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-15254-15684 so another way is to take uh i think is take campus rider

S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-17276-17405 by walking back
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-17416-18072 to the south spine you will see a lecture theatre called tan chi tuan so there's a bus stop there you can take the green bus over there

S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-57258-57803 okay so vivo city is at actually at harbourfront m r t station
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-57819-58185 so hubor fry and multi station there are a few ways to go
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-58214-59260 the first way is okay you from n t u you always start from boon lay m r t station so from boon lay you can take towards tuasing but you alight at outram park
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-59445-59880 so at our turn park you have to change to the
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-59995-60502 north east line so from northeast line you take towards the direction of ho harboor front
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-60512-60655 which only one stop ah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-60688-60858 or you can go to
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-61044-61489 bona ri star on the green line alight over there then you change to circle line
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-61511-61888 so from circle line also the direction is towards harbourfront ya
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-62050-62191 directions
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-62935-63169 oh ya okay so
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-63176-64104 actually for uh singapore singapore is known for a food city there are a lot of local food where you can find in hawker centre and coffeeshop
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-64123-64716 so i would i think i personally will recommend um chicken rice and laksa
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-64728-65284 you know these two are my favourite and chicken rice is internationally known as one of the singapore local food
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-65549-66777 okay so for chicken rice right there are i think there are three more important things to chicken rice number one is definitely the chicken so we have quite a few variations one is white steamed chicken another one is roasted chicken
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-66793-67414 number third is soya sauce chicken and one more is um if this is less common with the fried chicken
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-67424-67813 ya so most of singaporeans eat roasted chicken and white steamed chicken
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-67816-68635 so it depends on your preference for white steamed chicken is very healthier is healthier so because they simply buy it
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-68641-68923 and they'll i think they marinate it a bit
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-68930-70516 but for roasted chicken they are a lot to put a lot of sauces and spices okay then the next thing of important to chicken rice is the rice ah it's not plain white rice they do a lot of i think they put some what's that called err is it uh what's called ah let me think ah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-70678-71163 i think it's some garlic lah ya when they steam the rice so they add more flavour to the rice
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-71194-72273 and lastly is the chilli so the chilli is one of the most important thing about the chicken rice because it adds very spice flavour into the rice and the chicken
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-72292-73140 so if if you like you want to try something that is uh authentic and local i think that chicken rice will be best for you
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-73147-73607 then if you want someone who can take spicy i would recommend the laksa
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-73613-74211 so laksa is just curry gravy with noodles and some prawns and fish cake
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-74252-74367 ya
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-74629-75187 um for chicken rice yes there are a lot of stores selling chicken rice i mean at our
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-75202-76355 hor our okay there's a canteen near our hall which called tamarin they sells chicken rice and at south sp spine which the n b s school there's a kofu also sells chicken rice there's a star sells chicken rice
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-76370-76565 for la star i think
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-76604-77036 um i cannot remember any store selling like sars ah in n t u
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-77068-77194 pay
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-77355-78000 um you can get laksa at jurong port which is at the boon lay m r t station near there so there's a food set food court
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-78005-78172 ya and level four i think
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-78973-79377 okay so we have chinese malay and indian
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-79685-80245 for chicken rice uh it's called hainanes chicken rice it originates from ha na island
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-80250-80755 so is's definitely from chinese activityity laksa also
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-80790-81353 ya for if you want to try something from the malay ethnicity i think i would like recommend nasi lemak
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-81388-81700 ya so it's like um
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-81704-82334 it's also rice but the rice is different kind of flavour so they do use pandan leaf to steam the rice
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-82343-82834 and they do have the very nice delicious chicken wings and egg and chilli
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-82873-83437 then for indianity i think that um maybe you can try roti prata
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-83445-83731 ya so it's more of a dove
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-83744-84060 they use dove and flood they kind of
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-84077-84284 um you know pizza
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-84302-84652 ya so it's something similar to pizza the shape
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-84661-84835 but they dip it in curry
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-84862-85336 ya so it's and it's there's no other ingredients pineapple and ham we just plain dough
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-85421-85666 and then you fry it on the frying pan
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-86114-87819 um for dessert singapore i think uh other than normal ice cream we do have something like er ice kou ya so is mainly ice covered with flavoful different colourings of syup
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-87831-88515 and redb bean so because singapore
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-88518-88833 um ice dessert and stuff lah ya
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-89095-89409 um for singapore drinks
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-89421-90074 we do have um for more local one i think you can drink try milo i s milo
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-90094-91148 ice stay and or ice kopi so why is ice sta or ice kopi okay te just actually tea in english so they do have they put condensed milk in tea
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-91151-91291 then they put some eyes
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-91297-91962 for kopi is what you known as coffee but it's different i think it's quite different the coffee in singapore
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-91964-92282 because they use different coffee the different powder
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-92583-92824 then for the milo i don't think you
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-92850-92986 which country you're from
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-93077-93337 cambodia i don't think cambodia serve s milo right
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-93356-93748 ya so milo is actually an australian brand so it's something like coco
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-94138-94268 yup
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-95881-95991 okay
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-96177-97925 okay so this is botak is simply misbot means someone with no hair ya so in like a good example would be because every singapore che board lah everyone must don't have cannot have hair
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-98328-99552 this is called boo means that um example you go out with your friends then another then you post out on social media so another friend of your all saw it and they say eh why you boo me they say why you never ask me along
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-99564-99981 so it's actually it's kind of a salty feeling ah ya
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-00537-01109 okay my name is muma zahin binomad ali and i'm majoring under biological sciences
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-01439-01796 ah yes because like i was from um and
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-01798-03290 ne ann poly and i was doing my diploma in mocular biotechnology so right after i graduated that was my next choice was to go under n t u s biological sciences actually i preferred i wanted to go under n u s but the cut of point was too high so that's that
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-03509-04003 uh for my g p a because i barely got into n t u s um
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-04015-04310 degree course because i graduated with like a
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-04352-04788 like i think a few points more than the cut off point for n t u s
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-04796-04998 biological sciences so that that's why
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-05479-06169 okay when i was young like story time from when i was young um i wanted to be an archaeologist
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-06254-07238 then i realised that i couldn't be an acologist in iaeologist in singapore
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-07247-07522 be a doctor but then i thought about it i'm like
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-07541-07664 i'm not smart enough
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-07691-09109 so why and then i wanted to do to do um medical examineer because i really felt uh compared to study the human body but at the same time to go for that it will require a bit it's a bit of a tough
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-09276-11064 what do you call that specialisation to do compared to something like biology in general because i can go in many different fields from graduating so that's why like when i was young i wanted to do lab work and from then on i got the chance to do it after i went to diploma
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-100627-102049 to me i i mean i was uh i managed to go into a specialist schoold school then i became a sergeant and they graduated then i was thrown to uh pull out tekong as a sergeant over there and i had to deal with recruits
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-102410-102558 i would say it was
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-102609-103049 it helped in a way because um i don't really enjoy
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-103055-103385 scolding as much as unless i really have to
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-103389-103945 so i find it kind of ridiculous when people just burst into rage for something that's so small
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-104101-104397 that's when i actually like was able to like
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-104628-105244 understand from their perspective what they're going through and me being someone who has gone through what they've gone through
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-105259-106472 enables uh i can use that experience to actually empathise with the situation and try to find solutions to what they're going through because in the end like when it comes down to people you you have to work with if
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-106480-107011 you do not address the the problems from the start it's going to turn out into something ugly at the end
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-107077-108124 and that's what i feel about working with people um even if we are of different ranks you you cannot just expect people to just listen to you just because of that rank you know
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-108138-108414 it's it's kind of ridiculous and
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-108431-109161 some people do that and i don't agree with it but to which his own but for the way that i work is
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-109181-109529 um by mutual agreement and there has to be some
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-109559-110108 form of mutual agreement to reach that common goal and that goal is actually to learn stuff to defend our country
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-110353-111180 it's not to do with power play it's nothing to do with um politics i mean of course there's politics and work and whatever but
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-111192-112211 like if you base your leadership on just politics and power play it's it will work but it's not going to work to your favor when the time comes for you to actually
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-11152-11553 and that is when i interned over at um i entered over at
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-112261-112579 like defend the countries over that you need to depend on
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-112603-113140 um loyalty to your friends to each other and
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-113159-113502 caring and all that good vibes and stuff
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-114216-114356 okay
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-114536-114672 especially school at school
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-115075-115391 um okay mm
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-115695-115886 i mean physically it's a lot of running
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-11589-11893 a v a and that's when i realised that i
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-115918-116160 here and there um but
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-116183-117670 i guess the the accumulation of all the trainings right actually led to the when we had a one month ish uh training in thailand and that was crazy because the temperature there was about the highest temperature recorded was forty five
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-117758-118779 and the dryness level it is so dry okay the thing is that i'm okay when you sleep on the bed right there's fan but sometimes the fan doesn't work because the bunk is just
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-118824-119213 old okay and then um like when you wake up
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-119247-119419 your bed would be full of sweat
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-119533-120140 and like we were all guys lah so we just basically s sleep like in just your aunties and stuff because it is really really hot
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-11965-12494 i i think i have to drive to to do lab work more than i have to drive to talk to people
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-120197-120994 and then in five minutes the stain the whole sweat stain will just dry up and then there will be like a patch there and they will just try it's that disgusting
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-121074-121606 in about that time because at nine m in the morning right it's already thirty seven thirty eight degrees celsius
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-121703-121920 ya it's it's mad then um
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-121927-122622 so we had this um exercise i don't know whether i'm i can say this though because it's army
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-122650-122779 i'm not sure okay
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-122806-123371 okay but let's just give you the the small things that we did lah i mean we we walk around um with
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-123485-123658 we did practice
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-123669-124161 of the whole exercise the walking around was like about three days and recovered about how many kilometres
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-124260-124718 uh how much ah everyday i covered about fifteen so i would say about fifty
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-124731-125416 is that fifteen forty five to fifty i mean if you're lucky you cover forty five fifty you're unlucky to cover sixty ah because you go back and forth
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-12533-13053 so uh that's that in terms of my passion for biology
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-125474-125691 ya it was fun because um
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-125733-125933 i slept under the stars
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-126054-126994 at night it was like because it was free and easy so we were just by ourselves then we getting the whole area and if you got lost then we had we had to use um
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-127046-127633 they will call this like long range um walkies but they're not really walkies at like this whole big scene set that we have to carry around
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-127656-128211 so ya what's fun mm but that's a general idea of it lah cause i don't know how much i can disclose
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-128215-128380 i'm not sure that's the thing
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-13497-13691 my favourite module um
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-13958-14088 favourite module
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-14116-14277 god um
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-14438-15001 actually now i think about it i would say my favourite module would be physiology
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-15021-15779 cause i i took it in um when i was in poly and also when i'm doing my degree now and
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-15806-16331 it's interesting because you can actually link link up the things that you've learnt from
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-16355-16961 uh physiology all the way up to your current activities and what you do
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-16966-17365 so when i read um sometimes when i read um
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-17427-18131 doctors uh prescriptions or testimonials regarding my parents or my grandparents it's easier for me to understand the
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-18143-18513 um the words that come come uh that were written
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-18525-19237 but in general like even if i don't understand if i google it i can get the limit terms to understand what is being written so i get a better idea
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-19276-20056 so ya that's i guess it's my favourite right now but in terms of like electives i'm taking philosophy and it's quite interesting
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-20262-20462 i'm taking philosophy or friendship
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-20473-20687 to be a better friend
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-21097-21345 it's really it's easy to understand
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-21354-21927 because it's elitable to what you do and even if i i mean it connects back to moral ethics and
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-21931-22232 although moral ethics is a bit confusing ah cause i never really took it
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-22330-22507 the fact that it connects to
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-22532-23718 things that you can actually understand and um use in real life context it's interesting and ya it's it's not difficult in the sense of modern philosophy i tried to go for one class and i just
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-23774-24268 zoned out because she was talking about um personal identity and didn't identity and i didn't get it
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-24293-24884 ya but in terms of friendship it's it's quite simple um the differences between love and friends and like
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-24938-25676 the fungibility problem and stuff like that um so it's relatively quite simple and the fact that it engages
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-25679-25904 a different like part of
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-25968-27508 my study what about what i saying like a different part of my brain somewhat to actually like think about this scenarios and come up with plausible answers for it it's interesting as compared to it's more interesting as compared to biology because biology is very straightforward
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-27520-28370 um the answers are either there or not there and if it's not there just have to find the answers theres but in philosophy there's no straight answer to it it's so it's arguments as those perceptions
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-28494-28967 it's it's more engaging to the brain right than just straightforward answers
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-29712-29814 concepts
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-29844-29955 um
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-30077-30314 ah concepts oh god
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-30727-30961 mm wait let me think about it first mm
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-31485-31672 well like i feel
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-31700-32004 okay there's this concept on aristotle that talks about
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-32006-32110 um
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-32149-32764 only the good people can can actually achieve the perfect friendship but in general like i feel that
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-32796-32969 like um
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-32979-33514 people who have inadequacy like unequal um basis of virtues they
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-33526-33993 can get that same amount of friendship if the virtues actually overlap with each other
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-34015-34432 and like they complement and the way they complement actually um
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-34486-34904 it brings both of them into higher level of thing uh of character
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-34968-35136 so that's why i feel that
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-35304-36213 the basis of friendship shouldn't just be because that oh you're good and i'm good so therefore we should be friends doesn't mean like that it should be complimentary to each other and if
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-36224-36748 two people are all good then doesn't make sense for them to actually be friends because
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-36793-37103 they wouldn't actually bring added value into the friendship
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-37190-38189 so that's my opinion about that and i there's other things about philosophy but i'm i'm not good at it i'm just like learning stuff because i enjoy it not because
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-38201-38532 i very good at it or anything but like ya
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-38948-39737 oh right now i mean uh harmonics i'm doing a capella with the school uh with n t u harmonics ya
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-40200-41386 ecapella is to me it's one of the toughest form of singing because uh i've done singing when i was younger i from when i was in secondary school primary school city liah we all started somewhere
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-41419-42170 ianana zain oh my gosh but like um those were the divas of the era and still a diva im not saying anything about it
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-42206-44113 i can't match up to them so i i i kind of like learn my own style of singing and like i enjoy the art of it because it's it's one of the things that actually got me through poly itself because i was in uh sun composing club and we ventured under different genres and experimented with music original music from different genres
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-44125-44338 so like um
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-44391-44973 that's where i first started performing and stuff but like solo singing and acapla singing is two different things
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-45039-45178 acapella is
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-45233-45990 tough because like strings of an instrument a views play the wrong note it just turns to a different court and then everything gets thrown off
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-46036-46241 and that that's my problem
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-46262-47018 actually being rooted to a note uh and actually being able to sway with the note without uh going a bit too sharp or or too flat
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-47023-47772 but in general it's been a it's been a very enjoyable experience with everyone because we come from different backgrounds of music and different styles
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-47790-48349 so everyone has their own sty stylistic interpretation of music and how it's supposed to be presented
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-48372-48562 and the way
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-48621-49089 this mix happens it's enriching to myself because i get to enjoy
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-49102-49209 different
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-49244-49707 music forms and different people from different works of life and it's
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-49727-49855 it's something that
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-49870-50015 um
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-50049-50514 has been fun and i do enjoy it and i do wish to see more of it
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-50587-51123 although i feel that like um we shouldn't restrict ourselves to just pop music
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-51839-51984 mm sure
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-52826-53107 i would i i would say it's like a special kind of thing
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-53479-53579 really
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-53666-54085 oh ya ya we are though uh like uh we just
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-54117-55148 okay i was from a c s orientation club and like i joined a c s c special club for a special events and from then on then i realised that oh harmonics wasn't
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-55217-55457 um and a c s c club yet
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-55476-56369 but as as of last semester when c c day happened in n t u we wereficiated into the club um and that was
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-56416-56963 it was nice to get recognition for the work that the seniors did and i would think that
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-56999-57480 their efforts really transpired into something that what's really concrete in terms of
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-57523-58316 getting that recognition that we need not to get funds to to actually do our programmes and make sure that everything runs smooth
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-58326-58783 because it's hard being a solo c c a without any backing from any monetary funds
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-59395-59797 mm it's it it is m ya
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-59995-60763 uh for me music is my passion um but i enjoy reading sometimes
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-60851-61522 but i haven't read enough the past year because um well i just um
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-61542-61821 oh i did last year and then
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-61846-62971 uh n s took a lot of my time and then uni is taking most of my time so i'm waiting for some break to happen so i could just like read more and be more literate
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-63066-64288 in a way it's kind of like ya she williteter and shit but um it is it's important to read lah i mean i gain more much more perspective than just being stuck on an island with people i don't really know
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-65103-65252 i don't know what's drama
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-65261-66050 because i'm too lazy to catch up with the whole thing i mean the only dramas the only like like so called uh comedy is it called chick
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-66097-66729 i don't know what i recall um i used to watch two broke girls because i broke to
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-66732-67061 mm what else that one mm
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-67066-67284 friends obviously who hasn't watch friends
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-67296-67609 ah oh wow um
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-67616-68280 how i met your mother vet too mm other than that like not really much i mean i i do
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-68282-68574 watch anime here and there i mean just
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-68582-68848 just for the fun of it because i like cartoons
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-68865-69052 more than real life dramas
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-69112-69481 which is kind of weird because i'm old enough to like real life dramas but i don't
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-70200-70314 ya it was
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-70831-71290 okay in secondary school i was in um scouts
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-71522-71627 ya the
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-71722-72214 primary school there is but i wasn't in scar primary school primary school i was from in life science club
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-72343-73436 ya in my i was from to ka primary school and we had like life sciences club so i did hydroponics i did um gardening i did i did um all extractions random stuff like that
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-73503-73612 ya but
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-73772-74063 probably in a in a weird way
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-74118-74314 i guess um but like
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-74320-75845 ya in terms of secondary school it was scouts and u mm it was fun lah although people would say that it's like oh scout it's all uniform groups and stuff like that but i think i learned a lot about myself from that ya because um i was given an opportunity to
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-75879-77090 be able to hold a leadership position in that um that club itself and that exposure itself brought me to different people of like like from different schools and then we actually were able to
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-77333-77894 converse and share experiences between each other and that's the important thing and the the
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-77913-78098 the way scouts works is that it's
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-78109-78550 like a union between kids who have a mutual passion for
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-78553-79027 the outdoors and survival skills and stuff like that so it was
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-79061-79438 fun and i managed to go for a jamborie which is a
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-79442-79572 which is like um
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-79724-80256 this was like i think in my sec four years or when i graduated it's like a ge is like
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-80270-80817 um gathering of different scouts from the whole like from the whole world
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-80834-81404 so like the like every continent or every like so called not continent i mean every country
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-81416-81660 uh who has scouts in their
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-81714-84574 country yes they have like they actually send over um scouts like a few handful of them to singapore's we talked we have conferences and then we we just talk about uh all lot of experiences we share and like i managed to talk there was a bit of language barriers ah between us like i tried talking to cambodians but it was kind of tough
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-84670-85541 um it was just like the the their english was okay just the the structure of their their tenderances is a bit awkward i guess it's cause of the native language itself
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-85581-85920 and thais and i talked to
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-85937-86095 there were a lot of malaysians
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-86126-86418 um but in terms of
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-86552-87194 oh ya i remember the reason why the reason why there was no white people is because it's an asian thing like asian
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-87221-87944 so there was a lot of um japanese there were they were china doesn't have any skills
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-87988-88363 mm okay koreans i think i'm not sure i cannot remember
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-88983-89790 wow okay um ya it's a it's a it's a generalisation i mean um okay
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-89806-89922 ya i do
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-89963-90205 you look like someone who who will be from girl guides though
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-90234-90343 n p c c
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-90434-90578 oh oh
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-90600-91995 okay but okay um life skills i would say like um given i mean in any form of leadership uh role you would have the you would need to lead a bunch of people
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-92001-93239 to a common goal and from then on you learn how to manage your time kitchen studies and the c c a itself and like learn how to talk to people of different backgrounds and in order to actually like
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-93302-93991 connect to people who do not have the same background as you you have to really try to empathise and with their
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-94137-94438 them and what they've gone through and understand
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-94440-94618 from their point of view
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-94660-94906 how they perceive things to be
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-94946-95730 and that's important an important life skill because it makes sure that you're able to work with different people and not just with people you like
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-95816-96127 ya it's a it's a bit of like you have to learn how to give and take
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-96170-96559 because there will be people who want to like um piss you off
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-96793-97111 because i mean just because they want to pay off
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-97348-97856 you have like everyone everyone wants good for themselves and if you can motivate them to actually find that
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-97860-98028 good in whatever they're doing
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-98060-98983 then it will be easy for you to actually coordinate with people and the hard part is actually trying to find that common goal for everyone to reach
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-99030-99513 and ya that's one thing that i would say i kind of plan but i have not perfected it
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-00313-00528 hello oh yes i'm singaporean
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-01249-02865 from lakeside to orch park okay so right we are at now if you make a straight if you walk straight up and turn it about turn to the left at about three hundred metres you will see a sign that says um m r t just follow the m r t sign and you probably reach to lakeside m r t
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-02880-03439 and from then on right just take um the train from lakeside from the green line
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-03442-03952 that says that's going all the way to pasir ris take the train towards pasir ris
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-03961-05105 and from then on you would reach probably in about um one two three four five six seven eight nine ten in about approximately ten stops
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-05121-05478 and that when you exit the train then you that you are at orchard park
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-06559-07062 i would suggest that you take a bus because you'll be going through from
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-07069-07222 it'll be a bit
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-07338-07808 saying that you'll be going through from um south to north part
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-07827-09616 of singapore i mean i'm not really sure about the buses that we that we can take but i could probably google a maps for you but if you want to take an m r t it's m it's possible but i wouldn't advise it although um probably could just take the train towards jurong east and transit from the green line over to the red line and from red line you can just
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-09618-09844 take um at about
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-09854-10347 one two three four five six seven stops and you reach woodlands m r t
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-100225-100663 the urgency to do something in a faster motion or to get people to actually move
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-100687-101790 faster for you so let's say if i were to say uh come on guys let's do this work chop chop then we can go home basically means that i asking them to do the work in a like
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-101824-102199 more it it's there's this like urgency to do that work
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-102211-102456 so that we can all go back home
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-103022-104058 yup in a way you could you could use it in a way that's like a a a fast motion to ask someone to actually do things in a more urgent manner because you have to go somewhere or something like that
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-104574-104767 oh it's from us as atas
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-104908-105298 atas so okay let's say um
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-105423-105584 let's say
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-105617-106033 um i buy a branded good that is not
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-106055-106305 that is not like it's a it's a counterfeit
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-106331-106692 and then like my friend will tell me that i just want to
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-106715-107011 b atas in a way like like
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-107015-107369 um there's another like singlish word to it which is like step atas
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-107376-108006 step is basically steps but in our singlish uh context it's more of like trying to be
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-108019-109164 and then atas itself basically means like you're like above everyone else so you're trying to be birth from everyone else and in that case it's like saying that you are above everyone else because you buy branded goods but it's
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-109188-109440 but it's not proper because it's counterfeit
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-109449-109831 so that's why it's like trying to step atas that way
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-110179-110471 it would you could describe someone who's rich as atas
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-110652-111067 it basically means that you are like of higher standing or higher standing than others
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-111076-111468 so you also mean like let's say your grades is very good then you basically atas ah
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-111734-111895 above average i would say
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-112815-112956 um
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-113166-114263 the thing about singlish singlish language is that it's very um we cut out words that are not needed inside the context of the whole sentence so we get to the point as soon as uh as much as we can like
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-114280-114675 just straight to the point so when you say act cute right it's like
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-11477-11782 well i would suggest that you could go to
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-114807-116542 it's like a short form for someone who is acting cute but you just want to like say it out straight get to the point so cute so you just cut out all the unnecessary words which is acting you cut it out to act so in his little context it just means someone who is trying to
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-116554-117008 be adorable trying to be cute see that kind of sense
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-117222-117696 um i mean i don't see it in a negative connotation too because if
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-117717-118166 i'm so called acting cute that means there's some form of me that is still cute
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-11785-12553 i mean there's a lot of nature reserves not a lot but there's considerably enough facial reserves in singapore i wouldn't recommend going to the zoo because
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-118345-119525 and i don't sit in a bad light but some singapore's
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-119900-120293 you cute but the thing is that the cat is already cute so doesn't really make sense
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-120972-121086 macam
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-121108-121817 okay um macam itself is derived from the word macam in malay which basically means like
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-121846-122969 so in general like this kind of words in singlish is brought upon by uh brought from different languages singlish itself is accumulation of different languages from or cantonese hokkien malay
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-122980-123597 a bit of tamil i would say but i'm not really sure where it comes from and also it's a very um
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-123683-124515 it's a vocalised kind of language when it comes to singlish so the way i said like i could say as macam or i could say as like u
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-124644-125073 um the context of the whole sentence itself it changes the the meaning of the word
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-125125-125634 but macam in general is um likening it to something else
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-12564-12993 like why go to the zoo when you can experience this experience nature by itself
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-125660-126342 so let's say like he eats like a pig so i would say err he eats macam
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-126359-126996 pick i mean although it doesn't really make sense in that case but if someone were to use match up it would be something like likening it to something else
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-127652-127883 oh no no no no but um
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-127923-128655 likening it something else it's like ya slightly literature literature ya like like ya you got what i mean
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-129004-129408 ya you could agree could do that i mean it's a bit broken singlish but you could
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-13003-13536 but if you do want to go to the zoo there's a bus from choa chu kang m r t that goes straight there
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-13576-13881 uh i have no idea how else to go to the zoo because
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-13886-14878 um what's the fact that i don't really go there that much but there is a bus for chu ka uh i i can we check from google maps where the bus is where you can take the bus from
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-15608-16041 well not really i mean zous are more like
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-16052-16347 of a tourist attraction but i would say the nature itself is just
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-16354-16839 i mean i've seen a lot of people running around there you could probably go for runs around there if you interested in that
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-16878-17720 but um it's much more toned down because there's not a lot of people over there and you could basically just walk around and experience
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-17792-18233 singapore's tropical areas i would say of
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-18259-18608 but i mean there's a lot of things to see over there i mean i i
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-18667-19008 there could be crocodiles down there if you're not careful
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-20215-21072 uh if you consider paying for transport to go over then ya you have to pay for transport but it probably cost you less than two dollars to go over there from autumm if you're from there
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-21140-22165 but entrance over there is free for everyone you got mixture reservoir got zng ai bulo reservoir you got fanji area i'm not really sure why kranji is that man
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-22174-22606 i mean where is it at but i know there's the sunai buli one which is in the north
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-22642-22867 north west side of singapore
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-23921-24235 um well you could go to sentosa
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-24270-24557 i forgot what is it called because i have never been there before
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-24613-24908 i mean after they revvamp the whole day where used to be called
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-24928-25132 ah i cannot remember what is it called
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-25145-25900 but the last time i went to that area was when i was like really young but you could check it out probably there's a website on sentosa um
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-26037-26352 directory regarding tourism board from the tourism board
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-26500-26649 from pictures
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-26664-27179 that i've seen from my friends instagrams and social media i would say it's pretty and nice place
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-27223-27602 price wise i'm not sure but you so you have to check it out from the website
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-28210-28439 oh it's simple uh basically just take
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-28454-28613 um
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-28616-29580 train to harborfront or you could take a bus to harbourfront and if you go inside the mall at vivo city you go all the way up you can either choose to actually cross by food
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-29614-29902 um because sentosa itself is an island off
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-29942-30191 the south coast of singapore
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-30214-30788 so you could probably go there via a train which is like a u wouldn't say train it's a monoreil
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-30833-31212 um and all you could choose to walk i mean it's up to you
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-31261-32202 but i would say you should take the train the monoro because it's faster that's one thing in singapore'
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-32261-32727 if you have a choice and you have the money to take a tram why why not take the tram
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-33459-33559 in my house
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-33764-34246 okay generally like not okay i'm kidding we doing that but um
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-34359-34502 i usually hang out
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-34549-34748 around areas where i can get food
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-34832-35357 um and that depends on where i want to go so usually like
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-35384-35632 as as a young person
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-35641-35961 the first place you would ever go with if you ever bought is
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-36071-36191 central area
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-36206-37136 um but for myself sometimes i'm too little to go over there so i'll just go to jurong area jurong east area has a lot of uh malls and wholesale malls with
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-37148-37353 different um
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-37361-37535 different brands that you could
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-37542-37779 patronise into it's already quite nice
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-38159-38415 oh town area is in i mean
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-38545-39012 um central of it all is orchard but actually extends all the way until
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-39219-39352 all the way until
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-39529-41004 i would say bugist area and raffles place area so about the stations for raffles place raffles place city hall um orchard somerset and bugis doubby got ros considered as town area
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-41045-41548 but um they are a bit far apart so i wouldn't recommend that you walk
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-41571-41847 unless the night time because then it's kind of cool
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-42026-42153 yup that is my
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-43613-44129 um okay the melion is basically um from the story of
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-44426-45349 it's a myth it's a form of legend it's not a myth is a legend because myth is based of something but it's a legend um of a
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-45360-45911 combination of two creatures which is the fish and the the mermaid and and a lion
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-45942-46506 if so the creature is actually ahead of a lion and the body of a fish in the form of a mermaid
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-46510-46719 so that's what they call it a melayon
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-47145-47684 i mean if you want to take if you want to paint it like one of your french gold could be it could be horizontal
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-48203-48625 okay it's in singapore river and it basically looks like um
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-48633-48855 a white marble statue
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-48891-49989 no i don't know whether's marble or not but it's a white colour um ya it's not marble it's white in colour and um it basically spits out water in a continuous fountain kind of way
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-50002-50412 um the main is dripping all the way until the
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-50436-51444 um i would say until the shoulder level of the mermaid the rest of the body itself is i bought it a mermaid with skills which is a tail area
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-52128-52299 ya ya google will help a lot
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-53104-53535 okay depend on do you want to take the scenic route or you just want to walk over there
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-53541-53938 i mean if you want to take the sea route or you just want to take the m r t over there straight
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-54067-54488 the sand ru be walking from clark key all the way down to raffles place
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-54808-55542 it's just the singapore river this skyline itself at at night it look nice plus the nightlife op be clark east a thing so you could probably go visit
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-55553-55859 around the whole area they have bars and like tapas
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-55862-56157 bus over there we can get food if you wish to
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-56180-56553 but if you don't probably just take
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-56563-56791 um the train
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-56863-57324 to raffles place and just take a walk over there i mean do you have to walk either way
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-57335-57741 but the cinic route will be from clarkie although it will take some time for you to walk there
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-59366-59665 what i eat for breakfast will be just bread
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-59724-60001 then sometimes half more eggs depends on my mood
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-60034-60395 but what singapore's
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-60417-60682 like a so called traditional way
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-60697-60914 um breakfast will be just
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-60935-61645 um kaya toas with butter on one side and kay on one side and kaya is actually just like coconut each jam
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-61792-62372 ya but it's just a coconut jam um sometimes it's flavoured with pandan or or they have this
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-62389-62959 um it's it's basically just egg and coconut ish kind of taste to it i i don't really know how to place it but it's
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-62961-63128 it's more on the
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-63202-63302 sweet
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-63320-63463 side of the palette
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-63510-63703 ya but it it taste like
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-63904-64029 smooth jam
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-64039-64930 but less of the prairie kind of taste to okay it's more of like i mean it's a coconut so ya but uh in general that is
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-64969-65396 a common singaporean um um breakfast toast
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-65400-65561 butter kaya
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-65609-65986 uh not butter it's more of margarine kaya and
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-65992-66182 um to
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-66392-66617 two eggs half boiled
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-66683-66989 and then they will just crack it and mix it with soy sauce
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-67012-67119 and
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-67121-67336 um black pepper
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-67470-67630 then they give you an entire
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-67676-67819 oh yes yes you have to
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-67897-68059 um
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-68093-68666 they do cook it for you and then they give you the the whole eggs after that but you have to break it and then put inside um
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-68688-68834 then crack inside the
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-68848-69237 a small plate for yourself and then usually for me i will take
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-69256-69390 um coffee
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-69427-69717 from the from the from the
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-69743-70088 food court itself because the coffee there is
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-70114-70884 they say in a form like um it's more concentrated than coffee outside so it's a bit sweeter so if you don't really like sweet coffee then it's
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-70902-71366 i would say you should ask for less sugar or less milk less condensed milk so ya
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-71915-72563 yes um i would say the the whole meal itself is about um two fifty to three dollars depending on where you are at
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-72635-73294 although if you were doing it at this area called a kopitiam it probably cost you about two fifty two seventy
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-73305-73751 depending on where you're at because if you're nearer to the city area then
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-73764-73903 uh it's a bit pricey
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-75397-75914 okay myself it's a uh my for myself i
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-75998-76947 i'm a mixed race person so i'm a mix of malay and indian so i'm not really culturally indian but i have a palate for indian foods
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-76973-77551 so in general i would say for breakfast if you're if you want to taste
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-77567-77779 um what malay
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-77793-78110 people actually eat for breakfast would be something like lon tong
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-78183-78347 and lontong is basically like
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-78369-78848 uh lontong is basically uh rice cakes with um
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-78930-79043 a sort of
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-79089-79335 makes um a sort of
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-79357-79671 i wouldn't say it's a curry but it's like a soup base with
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-79680-80004 um i'm not sure what the soup bas is made up of
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-80085-80359 but i know it's really tasty
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-80536-80709 mm
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-81455-81896 and the end version of breakfast would be to
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-81984-82961 to say is like it's like um you basically have like a paste that you that you mix it's like a waffle paste but not really a waffle place
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-82964-84121 i don't really know how to describe it because i've never really made it myself but you basically make it into a huge pancake and then you cook it until it's crispy and then you fold it into a large cylindrical shape and you serve it with
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-84131-84321 um three types of
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-84336-84589 curry not i won't say curry but three types of
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-84654-85137 curry pastes in some way there's one that's normal curry there's one um white coloured
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-85168-85660 pasty kind of curry that is more towards um coconut flavoured
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-85666-85775 in a way
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-85782-86249 and then there's the red version which is uh mixed with uh blended chillies and
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-86254-86494 um spices from the indian family
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-87602-87928 it's not really about the chicken but it's more about how the rice is cooked
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-87945-88573 it's um mostly cooked with i'm not really sure the the proper ingredients but i know there's ginger
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-88618-88849 because i found ginger in my rice before
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-88852-88973 um
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-89043-89171 i think this
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-89287-89908 um flavoured water that they use but i'm not really sure what kind of water is it is it i'm not sure
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-89913-90326 um but from the the way i smell it like there's a lot of ginger in it
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-90511-90644 from the smell
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-90716-91297 no i i i actually been into it so that was a problem but like um
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-91323-92547 ya and like the way the way the chicken is cooked depends on the the the chicken rice that you ordered it could be hiinanes it could be different forms as malay form of chicken rice but the basis of the rice itself is the same for all
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-92554-92712 all are different
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-92761-93055 um cuisines of different races in a way
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-93082-93714 but in general like um if you look at the chinese version of chicken rice itself it's
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-93728-94332 uh it's mostly steamed or roasted chicken and then there's they also have like different corporations with
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-94349-94462 um
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-94726-95003 but that will be dark rice already so it's not chicken anymore
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-95081-95497 uh in terms of the roasted chicken
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-95775-96367 so like that's what i feel about chicken rice itself like there's a lot of different variations of it but the basis is the rice itself
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-96775-96896 oh we love it
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-96910-97494 but we don't we don't like eat it every meal like if you were to eat chocolate every meal like it will probably feel like
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-97575-97701 uh ya
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-99498-100004 okay child chop is basically like what we singapore's
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-00351-00744 okay hi i'm justin and i'm majoring in english literature
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-01047-01224 uh yes it was
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-01282-01384 ya it was
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-01484-02309 uh because i really like literature and there's not much else i'm very good at so
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-02508-02728 yes i did all the way ya
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-02853-02996 uh
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-03020-03732 i think it was compulsory in secondary school then after that uh it was interesting ah it was more interesting than any other subject so ya
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-03735-03840 i guess so
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-04079-04236 uh year four
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-05262-05962 uh yes in my first and second year i joined the school we tai and brazilian jujitu club
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-05986-06404 then uh in my second year also i joined er aeella group
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-06431-06819 ya and currently i'm only still in that a group
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-07195-07931 he's actually those aren't proper c c they interest groups lah but uh we meet once or twice a week you know we
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-07950-08461 err likes for those interested in fighting but
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-08464-08722 moai is a lot of uh
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-08729-09519 kicking and punching whereas b t j is a lot of floor work so you are hugging a lot of people on the ground rolling around ya
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-09692-10166 no not good but because the guy i liked was there so i went there
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-100372-101736 oh um oh they have this thing called uh i think the curriculum is midies ya where they separate the different part remember i was talking about the soprano auto all that ya so they ur have a
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-101912-102467 like a i won't say video audio recording of each individual part which you can listen to
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-10196-10459 ya
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-102479-103254 ya and i'm more of a audio learner than a visual in this case cause i can't read notes so ya that helps a lot
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-103535-103679 correct ya
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-103831-103958 or definitely
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-103977-104944 err have to combine with the other people and stay together but i think seeing together also is very important ya so
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-105040-105679 practice is very important yes both with yourself and with the entire group yes ya
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-106375-106488 yes that's
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-107066-107381 uh
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-107598-107854 personally for me uh
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-10769-10971 uh i think it's
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-107922-109123 well i mean for one thing it's finding the right people to sing with people you want to sing with but after that also i think it's translating uh your normal singing into performance singing
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-109132-109921 ya because err singing to each other is very different from performing to a crowd of people ya
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-109934-110513 and that goes back to that thing i was saying about stepping out of my comfort zone because
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-11000-11313 quite hard unless somebody ah like
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-110517-110903 like for example when i perform i like to look at the floor i don't have to look at people
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-110909-112708 because it's easier to concentrate on my note when i look at the floor but ya so you like maintaining eye contact making sure you look like you're enjoying yourself or appropriate to whatever the mood of the song is and if choreo is necessary remembering your choreo but still singing properly
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-112718-112833 so the the
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-112848-113286 entire performance aspect of acapella is something that is
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-113296-113596 difficult for me ya but
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-113847-113985 ya uh
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-11403-11834 it's not really self defence but it's a good form of exercise
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-114035-114733 but i mean that's the whole point right to get better so hopefully ya especially the dancing part
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-114761-115010 cute
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-115486-115978 err ya currently i'm the welfare officer for the club yes
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-116106-116756 uh supposedly lah yes yes yes i try i try i try yes a
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-116879-117024 uh
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-117604-117770 it's very hard to
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-117791-120097 uh individually help everybody because uh of the way the club is and i think it'll be difficult or for them to want to approach me specifically as well because i'm sure they have their own problems but uh as much as i can like for example we help celebrate their birthdays we organise bonding events for them and uh
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-11848-12311 but maybe cause i suck at it if you are good at it maybe you can use it in real life ya
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-120127-120615 ya but currently due to a lack of uh concrete
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-120632-121134 uh or permanent club room i think like a lot of uh what i could do
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-121145-121286 uh cannot be done ah
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-121296-122208 ya because we move eh we have a room in the hive but uh i mean it's a common classroom so we can't leave any of our stuff there
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-122555-122674 you're welcome
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-13137-13441 no outrun
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-13680-14301 if i can help can help lor but if not i would it will make more sense to live and get help from elsewhere yes
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-15076-15272 yes i stayed during my first year
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-15463-16059 uh as in whole life wasn't for me
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-16081-17169 uh it was very tiring and everybody wanted was always doing something you had to be doing something or like in a lot of committees in order to ensure how stay for the following year
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-17178-17787 and i just felt like a lot of effort for me and i couldn't have time to study or have time to myself ya
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-18060-18160 ya it was
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-18179-18302 ya correct
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-18654-19285 so like they have a lot of subcommittees and committees uh for different events so uh i had to join
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-19317-20878 the how block committee the subcom and then to join like their newspaper slash magazine subcom also and a whole bunch of different sports slash err what do you call them games that's why i think there was err

S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-27538-29122 i mean we sing ah erh we we have different we have like subros each group has about maybe six to eight people and then uh we have our own repertoire each group and then we go out and do gigs
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-29129-29239 ya
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-29720-29849 from normal singing
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-29852-31533 uh one one thing acap bellla means uh without i believe it means to without instrument or purely vocal so ya that's one thing then another thing is uh because i was from choir secondary school and j c uh and that is safety in numbers whereas acapela is one person per part
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-31539-31741 so that uh
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-31747-32322 really causes you to have to believe in yourself and in your teammates ya
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-32358-32458 a bit different
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-33124-33473 to be honest i really hate performing i'm very shy
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-33477-33902 uh after now i still don't really like it ah but uh it's
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-33929-34409 fun and enjoyable to perform with my teammates so
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-34413-35425 that encourages me to step out of my comfort zone so every time we perform i'm stepping out of my comfort zone but ya but it's okay because i'm not alone that i are there
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-35438-35580 ya
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-36174-36307 correct ya
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-37040-37855 err was the sorano in choir then when i came to acap pela i they made me auto but then now they made me swab again so
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-37869-38022 i suppose it has same
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-38286-39774 soprano so they have like different sections this is from highest to lowest uh sorano autoto tenure base and then in between they have like meso so which is like in between sorano and alto and bey tone which i believe is in between tenner and base
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-39785-40169 ya so it's just different sections for your vocal range yes
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-40344-40585 you
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-40620-41424 play a keyboard and if you can hit the note i suppose that is your range i'm not a musical person
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-41623-42513 i think it's highly recommended that you have musical background but uh it definitely helps lah like reading notes and stuff but no i don't have musical background yes
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-43156-43664 this will take a very long time because i need to think about there are a lot of performances um

S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-67965-68607 attitude towards uh receiving the learning and he's not bad like he's quite receptive and he's quite smart
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-68615-68809 but he's very lazy so
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-68844-69041 pros and cons ya
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-69379-69508 um
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-69691-70232 for example he will complain like every time ask me to do something he will complain but err
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-70239-70342 i guess it
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-70409-71463 a mixture of like letting him complain a bit because i mean you've been there before you understand how you don't want to do something but uh also encouraging him
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-71466-72240 like especially when he get something right i he respond very well to positive feedback ya so that's been helping
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-72681-73155 yes i am stereotypical literature student err
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-73158-73353 job but yes ya
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-73576-73739 uh as in
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-73977-74926 i i didn't want to teach literature so it would be j c but there's no demand for that currently so i suppose primary school because i like working with kids
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-74943-75060 ya
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-75523-75638 uh
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-75885-76372 wow personal questions uh
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-76375-76676 ideally i would think too
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-76682-77143 kids ya one boy one girl ideally but you cannot control this kind of thing so
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-77152-77252 ya
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-77626-77991 no i have a younger sister ya that's right
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-78155-78259 fantastic
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-78267-78377 ya
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-78419-79795 ya i didn't mean that sarcastically u in the past when we were growing up i think we fought a lot but after a certain point i think after she entered junior college then we just became very close
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-79821-80514 ya so we share everything and we talk about everything ah ya i mean we still fight that's normal but ya
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-80698-81119 err she's actually in n t u as well she's ar wiki ki wee major
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-81325-81937 err does she say no but she dances really well so the one thing i cannot do she can do very well
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-82121-82765 i think i think so so actually it's not fair she can do both probably but i can only do one
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-83484-84178 it it's been twenty four years and nothing has happened for me ah but i guess ya we shall see
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-84437-84731 oh my god okay yes i do
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-85539-85654 yes that's right
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-85774-86348 err yes i am this year actually but with a different group of people ya
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-86749-86933 oh uh
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-87006-87603 as in you want me to compare last year's group this year's group or in general oh okay
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-88091-88267 oh err
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-88303-89546 for one thing i mean personality to begin with is very important ah like if you all don't click on a certain level then it's very hard to firstly find songs that you all want to do together
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-89560-90789 uh because people have very different taste and another thing is perhaps your working style is very different maybe some people are more systematic some people a little bit more unorthodox and if you cannot work together then there are a lot of problems
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-91029-91144 uh
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-91176-91295 okay so
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-91312-91994 err when you learn scores or we learn when we learn songs you can choose to learn er via a score
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-92007-92917 and all the parts are nicely u written out for you or you could uh make your own arrangement which uh requires uh doing everything from scratch
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-92921-93350 or it could be taking a score and tweaking a score also so ya it
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-93365-94303 uh that's one part when i mean unorthodox i mean not following a certain set of instructions and another thing is uh how people learn
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-94351-94560 ya so some people
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-94567-95418 uh sit down and then they go through everything step by step but other people maybe uh not consistent ya only
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-95659-95871 ah my brain hurts like
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-95931-96103 it's as in basically
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-96108-96783 people work differently that's im by on orthodox ya if you're not the usual kind of learner ya correct
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-96970-97082 uh
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-97129-97239 to be honest
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-97348-98154 i want to say i am orthodox but i can't really read scores very well so i still need help from my teammates
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-98157-98420 but luckily they're all very talented so
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-98579-98697 oh thanks
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-99291-99561 thanks
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-01298-01519 ah okay um
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-01534-01793 uh may i ask which part of the north spine you are at
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-02004-02231 oh mcdonald's okay so uh
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-02241-02573 what you want to do is uh take
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-02687-04502 um the red line uh from lee winham library uh to the closest bus stop to the hive which would be innovation centre i believe so to get from mcdonald's to uh the bus stop you have to
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-04725-07020 go past this area it's a stage area and there are a set of large bound steps it's called canopy k i believe then uh following that there should be a overhead bridge walkway uh that connects the north spine to n i e so you take the first staircase that goes uh down to your right and the bus stop should be there
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-07027-07666 and ya you just wait for the red line i believe it's uh one two three
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-07703-08946 four stops and then you just get off and you should be able to see the hive the hive is easily recognisable it looks like a set of chinese dim sum err what do you call them
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-08971-09184 basket brown baskets yes
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-09422-09544 oh welcome
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-100653-101674 and uh i find out that you didn't invite me so i would tell you why bo uh bo uh why you bo teo that means why did you not ask me to go with you
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-10187-10317 mmhmm
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-101883-103189 ya so both if you split the word to to ba bo and jio jio is to ask somebody to go out and then bo is erh means you didn't ya so put together you didn't ask me to go ya
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-103690-103898 oh yes you can uh
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-103908-104391 can be for any activity ya not just two places yes
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-105151-105559 did not ask you why you wanted
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-105564-105966 why oh as in to do homework together um
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-106014-106874 uh i i suppose so bo can be used for like like i said any activity so yes i suppose so yes
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-10610-11238 okay so the nearest m r t station uh is called pioneer m r t and you will have to take a
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-107153-108221 but the kind of implies there's a accusation there that you didn't invite the persons i would think there is a negative connotation there to it yes
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-108746-109077 oh the merlion okay err
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-109121-109238 okay so
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-109245-109636 do you know of the story of sanni la guta mah
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-109746-111120 okay so long story short is this prince who came from somewhere and he landed on this island called temasek but basically he saw this magical creature eh
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-111165-112008 eh wait no that's not right he saw a lion okay never mind come back i maybe if you go tor sentosa i even to sentosa
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-112036-112490 ya yes so have you seen this gigantic uh statue of like a
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-112544-112939 think with a lion's head and the body of a fish
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-11257-14332 uh one a service bus u one seven nine out of school uh to get there and um so you can head to that same bus stop i was telling you about earlier on but instead of taking the red light which only uh goess around school uh you take the bus that this one seven nine and if you are unsure of exactly where to get off at i would recommend asking the bus uncle uh or aunty to uh let you know when you have arrived at that bus stop yes
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-112990-114078 yes yes so that thing right um it's uh so that's why it's called mer literally mermaid i think plus lion so it's umation of these two things it's
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-114095-114860 um supposedly said to be singapore's singapore's history or like literature is folk lor
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-114864-115145 but really it's uh
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-115171-115649 iconic err because the singapore tourism board has made it so
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-115653-116572 ya it's actually a part of singapore's tourism ya like icon it's not really anything to do with history or folk lor i guess
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-116746-117175 uh no it's not like a ya you can't use it like it
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-117189-117893 but you can say have actually wait you can use the word merlion i believe okay so if you notice right and if you err
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-117908-118226 that sentosa me is not the only place with a me
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-118241-118871 like i believe clark key as a mer li as well there's a it normally has a jet of water shooting out of its mouth
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-118889-119693 so when you say ur mer another way of u they it it could mean uh that i'm saying that you're vomiting
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-119710-119891 ya so
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-120005-120290 no uh
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-120313-120903 i don't know how to use this word but i've heard other people use it and they are basically the idea is that you are
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-120928-121352 project you are projecting vomit yes that's right yes
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-121506-121740 yes yes same
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-15307-15441 okay so uh
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-15461-20734 buses that run within school uh would you refer to the campus red line the campus blue line and i a few other colours which i cannot remember green and yellow i think but those are free uh and there's a another uh service that runs out of school actually but it's a in a loop so it will drop you at uh pioneer m r t which is that m r t you want to go to and it will come back to school but that uh loop which i think is called the what is it called green green line green rider i'm not sure school rider basically that bus uh only stops that very specific bus stops and it's not convenient uh considering you at mcdonald's for you to take that line so one seven nine would be faster but it's one seven nine u i believe the base price if you have student concession is seventy seven cents but it can go up to about maybe a dollar dollar twenty yes
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-20885-20992 um
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-21000-21427 student concession is something that uh all students in singapore have
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-21458-23705 uh from the morning you're in primary school up till uh university level so normally uh let's say a bus ride were to cost you maybe eighty five cents uh for a adult if you had a normal uh e z link card but if you had a student concession it might be a bit cheaper maybe seventy cents basically it's cheaper ya
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-23936-24207 uh for students or for adults
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-24347-24685 uh it's uh
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-24694-25558 it's a transportation card that there's a card that stores money inside that you can use to pay when taking public transport yes
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-25854-26070 yes that ti
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-26372-27010 uh you're currently exchange student right so i believe you could try applying for a
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-27050-28192 temporary student pile i'm not sure whether that works or not but if that doesn't work then you just have to get a normal e z link card which you can get from any uh m r t station i believe yes
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-29030-29222 oh we got okay
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-29231-30164 uh so you have to understand that there are a couple of different coloured lines uh on the singapore m r t then currently uh you are on the green line or the
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-30182-31645 east west line yes that's right so you at pioneer you want to get to doby got which actually is in the middle of singapore kind of so you're go to have to take uh just a straight train all the way till uh this stop called uh
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-31683-31855 raffles place
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-31901-33285 err because i prefer that stop because it's less crowded than the next stop which is called city hall ya so you take it to this uh m r t got raffles place and you change from this screen line to this other line which is the red line
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-33289-33422 or the
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-33471-33797 south line and you just take i think
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-33799-34202 one two stops then you reach doby got m r t
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-34483-35648 what is that to be got um well it's kind of at the tail end of orchard road so i suppose if you want to go there to shop or to eat or to catch a movie
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-35655-35909 ya you could do those things there
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-36773-37551 landscapes uh then i would recommend going to maybe the botanical gardens which is at
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-37602-38092 the m r t station called botanic gardens yes
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-38302-38556 from buy okay so um
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-38602-38721 you
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-38736-40570 uh from pioneer m r t you drop off uh you take it to boa vista m r t and uh from there you go to change from that green line to this other line which is the yellow line or the circle circle line yes and uh you' take how many stops one two three three stops to botannic gardens ya
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-40893-43163 ah okay so when you so that uh all trains like at they stop at m r t d platforms right so once you get off get on the platform you have to exit err that platform and possibly walk a certain distance to get to the other platform but there are a lot of uh clear directional sign as to how to get from one platform to another so i don't think you'll be confused yes
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-43463-43630 um
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-43653-43935 i think for one thing it's a
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-43976-44589 i think it's a national heritage site uh and it's uh i mean singapore's
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-44596-45074 garden city and if you want to go and see a lot of greenery and a lot of different kinds of
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-45086-45568 uh interesting plants then botany you should go there ya
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-45996-46602 oh i didn't think about that ya that's true okay so guns by the bay is at
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-46655-46815 i believe it's
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-46887-47552 the stop called near marina bay which is the tail end of the north south line
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-47572-47804 so stimulating you could take
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-47819-48191 from pioneer m r t till
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-48275-48416 uh what do you call that
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-48467-48635 honestly i don't know hold on
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-48843-49191 probably you would take to city hall and then change
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-49200-50039 to the red eh no no you go back to that raffles place m r t from just now and you would change to the red line and just take it all the way till the end ya
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-50467-50757 okay so guns by the bay is a
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-50779-51826 most okay so do they have a outdoor area and a indoor area but the indoor area for air guns by the bay uh is filled with i think imported plants that you cannot find in singapore
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-51917-53116 so but it's air condition so if you are feeling hot you know maybe you should go there but guard but err botanic gardens is free wa whereas i think garden vi the bay have to pay about twenty dollars to go inside
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-53639-53832 okay alright
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-54762-55010 will option ah
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-55047-55586 oh okay well i mean singapore
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-55619-56753 races and uh cultures right so it really depends on what you like um for example maybe dim sum might be an option that's a
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-56857-56969 chinese
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-57283-57576 i won't call it proper food but it's like
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-57604-58241 small proportion so it's good for sharing or good for trying if you are not that hungry
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-58249-58894 or maybe err roti prata which is like kind of like
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-58941-59277 pizza dough but without
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-59382-59545 toppings ya
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-59579-60004 ya but um actually no they have toppings but it doesn't look like a bit ah
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-60021-60665 yes but the's kinda dough like yes uh and uh if not you could try
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-60667-61044 porridge i suppose ya or
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-61087-61228 or
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-61233-61861 we do have uh what do you call this western american breakfast as well i mean ya which is
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-61863-62392 like if you have' we one your baked beans your bacon your scramled eggs they have all that
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-62407-63205 at like maybe mcdonald's mcdonald's breakfast yes which i quite like for their pancakes hotcakes yes
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-63372-63541 uh sometimes
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-63791-64112 err i usually don't eat breakfast
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-64125-65144 but if i do when i do eat breakfast it's normally bread uh with something inside like a spread or cereal ya
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-66245-66406 oh right
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-66421-67893 okay very good thanks i forgot about that uh so that is also another popular eating uh eating breakfast breakfast option um so basically you order toast and inside the toast they have but there's butter and this other thing called kaya
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-67945-69613 honestly i don't know how to describe kaya to you but it's sweet and it's quite smooth normally ya and it goes well with the butter and the toast and um so normally this toast will come with uh like you said the plate with two eggs right so those are uh soft po eggs
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-69645-70550 soft boiled eggs yes they are and then you just crack them open and then you typically mix it with a little bit of black sauce and pepper to taste
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-70563-71509 and ya that plus the eggs plus the toast plus probably a cup of coffee or tea would be a pretty normal breakfast
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-71740-72187 oh really depends on where you go but i think the cheapest i've had it is
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-72219-72468 two fifty two dollars
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-72488-72603 ya
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-72686-72802 correct yes
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-73684-73841 is is

S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-80826-81802 the chicken rice is itself explanatory but basically it's chicken like chopped chicken you have a choice between a white chicken and ah
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-81851-83719 and i want to say braiseded no roasted chicken there we go roasted chicken that one is the brown colour skin one the one with brown colour skin ya if not then it's white skin err and then ya normally chicken rice comes with err what's so special about chicken rice is the rice is not normal rice ya it's fragrant
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-83743-83888 with something
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-83897-84168 coconut no it's not coconut that is nasi lemak

S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-84345-85049 but yes chicken rice is pretty good but if you want rice but without chicken i would recommend nasi lemak

S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-85696-86047 chinese thing nasi lemak is more
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-86053-87541 a malay thing i want to say yes right uh and um ya so instead of the chicken what you have is like typically a piece of fried chicken or a piece of fried fish along with a tiny

S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-01688-02489 oh okay uh i'm in year two i'm studying renaissance engineering programme i'm specialising in civil engineering and ya
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-02723-05910 uh okay basically my course is a double degree sort of like a double degree programme so where the in the first year the students are exposed to uh broad based engineering and then in the second year onwards we will we will uh specialise in one engineering course of our choice and then in the third year we will be going for an exchange and then fourth year we come back uh halfway through a fourth year will be taking our masters ya so the masters is like some masters in information i i don't really know what the masters is actually ya ya but it's a four and a half year course
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-05914-06032 ya
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-06252-06550 uh ya in the first year was definitely quite
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-06587-09848 crazy for me i feel like the the change from a levels to uni cause everybody told me that uni was going to be like easy when i spoke to my seniors lah like easier than a levels ah not not okay ya but then i didn't feel that way ya everyday was just like a mad rush and during finals period it was just like wah intense but in the second year is much better cause okay in the first year we had every sem we took six finals and then uh in the second year we took a uh like for example this sem we only took three finals so it was like a lot more time ya a lot better
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-09853-10325 ya so right now it's not that bad but looking back was like quite crazy ah ya
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-101755-101939 i don't think it's inside mm
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-102457-103138 oh no no no uh for me i like i try to hit the hundred sixty grams but like in school okay cause i i'm too lazy to cook
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-103155-103492 ya so like what i do is i okay i drink one carton of milk everyday
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-103507-107500 ya then no lah but it's like u ski milk so it's like okay ya it's not that it's not like fat fat milk then u i take two scoops of protein powder then i eat like uh there's this bread called smart cup it's like the best bread for body builders in singapore lah so i take like two slices of that then that's like that will constitute about like hundred grams of my protein every single day then i'll usually i willll go out like when i go for classes and stuff like that i willll i'll buy like u i'll choose to get more protein lor like more eggs ah more chicken and then i'll get the remaining like fifty to sixty grams from there lah ya i don't cook my own prepare my own meals ahh ah unless it's like a long holiday or what then i have time then i can prepare but if in the if it's in the school term i don't i won't have the time ya
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-10476-10720 mm i just ended yesterday ya
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-10758-11011 uh quite easy lah i would say ya
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-108171-108500 uh okay i i don't do anything like really
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-108503-109668 as much as i do public thing already lah but then uh sometimes you mainly basketball lah but it's like recreational recreational games recreational fund ya with friends and stuff like that not ya mm
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-110181-110618 no no lah it really depends on how you okay like
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-11028-11134 ya
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-110626-113524 how an athlete wants to develop himself right it really depends on himself like uh so you see a lot of the body builds like those very massive guys right they are actually okay uh like okay this is not to like generalise of them lah but actually a few of them are actually like very theyre unfit like even though they might look very fit but they just have the looks they don't have the they don't have the like the athletic capabilities as like maybe like a small person would have like why why do i say that because body buildingding right if like you do not
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-113532-113698 uh do it like
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-113711-116673 there are they' like um if you don dot want to do it properly you can actually like it's quite harmful to the body lah i feel like for example um how would i say that like okay because like the traditional way of body building right is that you get big so that's called a bulkking season then you so like that's the season where u the body will like try to eat a lot and they will try to become very massive lah to get a lot of muscle mass so at that season they get really very fat they can the body fat can go to twenty five those kind of percent range so it's actually very high then
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-11494-11677 ya ya
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-116673-118011 they reach the percent range right then they will cut down so they will have this cutting season like before the competition so you then the cutting season right basically that's where your clean eating comes in you eat chicken breast your your healthy thing lah so
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-118045-121249 then that's why you try to cut away all the fat that you have gained during the balking season but you try to retain the muscle mass so your body becomes like lean and like it looks very good before for the competition but then if you you were to realise this kind of lifestyle is not very good what like it's just cycling yourself to like a lot of food and then like healthy thing for one period and then when you are going to the balking season like it's quite crazy ah you can eat anything you want ya you can eat like all the protein la but that's a traditional way but like for modern more modern like body builders right they are doing like this thing called like a lean lean bulk basic which which may see means right
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-121261-123735 as you are progressing like after the competition right you don't go like ape shit crazy and just eat all the food that you want to eat but you control yourself and you you just eat like um you eat moderately like while still allowing your body to grow but you do not like your yourself to get like balloon to like that kind of fat levels ya so that it's it's actually like i feel like it's healthier ya because you have not like going crazy anything everything you want so actually
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-12321-14429 oh uh okay i like to play i like to do all kinds of sports stuff lah last time i used to play basketball competitively but then i stopped when i went to the army and i didn't really pick it up after i come to uni so now what i like to do is i like to do power lifting so basically if you don't know is just like i going to a gym and performing three exercises ya squat bench and dead lift
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-123748-124701 body buildingd like uh it's not very healthy sport lah but then stamina wise i wouldn't say like if you were to like a normal person going to a gym i wouldn't say it would like the
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-124709-126941 decrease your stamina and whatever es unless you are you're saying like if you go to gym then you stop like running or stuff like that because like u stamina this kind of stuff comes from like uh aeroic activities one like uh running jogging swimming those kind of stuff then if you stop doing those kind of activities then definitely your stamina get worse lah or your speed will not be as fast uh you know you will not be as fast or stuff like that but going to a gym alone i don't think it will like
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-126947-127074 how many thing
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-127083-127743 ya unless you taking it too drastically or whatever then if not i won't think it it has like that big of a side fact
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-127747-127876 ya
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-128115-128244 okay
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-14441-15472 ya so uh then you just try to get your numbers higher and higher every every like time you go there so that's like what i'm interested in now ya that's my hobby mm
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-15847-18143 mm or self trained la i don't have money to follow coach actually it's not really important to like i mean okay not say not important but like i mean if you research enough if you read enough you can actually do a lot of things yourself and like self learn ah so that's why apply lor to my training ya and i have friends around me lah who like who are a lot more experience than me and who coach me along the way ya but i don't have like a formal coach or what ya
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-18956-20162 mm oh ya no problem so naming out u okay so basically there are like a set of rules that you need to comply to when you are in a competition so for example like the for the squat ah you need to squat like into a certain debt
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-20187-20685 such as like your hips are below parallel for you to be considered like a deep enough squat
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-20690-24726 those kind of stuff ah so uh basically this kind ofcis is not really like testing like okay like bodyil is like going for aesthetics and stuff like that but then for how lifting is uh more complicated than that it's not just like how you look or how much muscle mass you have but it's really like how you can eat like utisee your muscle fibbers so there's u apart from like having muscle right you need to be able to use the muscle groups like the muscle fibbers that you have so a lot of the body builds you see when they go to the gym they become very big then they are have they have a very large uh mass of muscle lah but then like because they don't have a specific training to teach them how to like utilise the muscle fibres
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-24745-25381 to the maximum potential so you see a lot of time actually not very strong like relative to the size that they have
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-25394-26610 but for power lifting you focus on strength so even the smallest of guys they can live like the heaviest of weights so it's really about training your central nervous system to perform to a peak like to come to a peak performance every time it
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-26618-26854 every time you are trying to perform a maximum leave
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-26889-27135 ya something like that
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-27158-27330 ya it's quite
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-28231-29088 uh okay like i mean people don't really discuss powerlifting in terms of static and dynamic forces because it's very like technical lah and i don't think everybody has the
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-29093-30281 like not everybody doing power lifting has the mile to discuss that but then i mean i mean it's definitely involved in uh in one way or another lah like although it's not really discussed but um
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-30316-34027 power this thing is more like aes static force i would say because the range of motion and everything you are doing right is like you're doing in one single plane ya like for example the squad you take out the you uh after you unride the bar right you are just in like one single plane and when you squad you are in a single plane so it's although it's like a dynamic movement but then you actually being in the u the position doesn't really change and the force when you are generating the maximum amount of force right is when you're in a stationary position at the lowerest point of your squatd so like after you squat down you want to stand up again right but then you have a lot of weight on your back so that is the point right like static point where you actually need to generate the most amount of force to bring your body up so
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-34062-34249 um like
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-34277-35574 when you go online and read stuff like that they don't really talk about forces lah i mean like cause not everybody will be able to understand it but then when you read right like you can co relate to what you have learnt in school like may may forces and stuff like that ya so definitely applicable m
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-35934-36348 uh for my scort i havequated two hundred k g before
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-36359-36706 dead if i dead withed two hundred and twenty k g before
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-36710-37004 and bench i have bench hundred and twenty k g before
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-37364-37472 mm mm
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-37673-37930 uh okay uh like cause i just started like
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-37935-40047 uh maybe like i have trip i've been train for one year ya so it like not a long period of time okay so to thing with public with thing is that right like from a lot of sports right as athletes grow older they actually decline in performance right so like let's say uh for if you are twenty one right you reach thirty years old right you will expect to peak around like maybe twenty five and then like um
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-40059-41229 okay lah maybe not so young lah but then for biology is different is's like as you grow older right like u miraculously you just become better in some in one way or another cause like a lot of the strongest power liftfters right they are actually like thirty plus
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-41233-42941 years old ya so uh given my short training experience i'm quite happy with my results actually ya but definitely nowhere near any benchmarks or what lah it's just a personal thing i set for myself ya i haven't really competed before also i just do it for like fun and because it's quite
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-42962-43280 like relaxing every time you go to the gym like as in
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-43283-45928 let's let's say i have a school day right then you have a very stressful day then you go to the gym you have like two hours of time where you can just like leave and then when you are doing the heavy waits right you cannot think about anything else because you cannot let anything affect your like u like the they call it the mind muscle connection ah basically you want your body to be prime when you are doing the lift so if you think about anything else is go to affect it lor so it's a way for me to de distress ah ya m
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-46323-50196 um u okay like the most important thing is to train safely like in the in the past when i started training i definitely did not like um did not understand that because i just wanted to get stronger everyday lah i wanted to live more everyday but then i realised that like u my it was quite reckless then the way i was training in the past like i can go like can go all out then have very little rest those kind of stuff and i didn't really like uh take note of my form so form basically is like the way you contact exercise ah so you have um when you are doing very heavy exercise like uh you you want to make sure that your body is safe mah so that's like where the form comes in if you don't train safely then your body will
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-50205-53835 like it i have a higher tendency to get injured lah so uh in the most important is to train safe i would say like in the past i got injured quite a few times and like when you get injured you get slo maybe you like injured like for one month you can't try cannot train for one month then when you come back you will you know you will not only lose the one month time because but then your results will roll back because you don't actually conduct the lift mah so you don't have the ya so you need to get it back the muscle memory so you'll take more time so most important thing is to train safely ya focus on form and like just have fun lor where you are doing it ya that's the best way to like get better as anything i feel
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-54130-54636 uh badly not not badly lah but then like definitely have injuries like they will
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-54642-56907 they will always like come and go ah it just depends on how you like deal with it so like uh minor injuries lor la maybe like the risk uh then sometimes like the back the bag is a like one of the like quite a softre spot lah ya even sometimes now it still have like strains here and there then whenever there strain you need to like take it slow easy for a while ya but no no like significant major injuries
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-57794-62266 oh okay uh so one thing is to not ego lift lah e lifting basically means like you know you try to live more than your body can actually handle ya so uh you you want to make sure that you progress you know you are progressing at a rate which you are comfortable with your your body is comfortable with then uh the then the form is also very important because like the way you the way you go down into a squat the way your back is like uh like how is it straighten or not straightened or is it like uh wobbly your body is wobby your stuff like that your knees are caving in stuff like that this u like indicators that your form is not good or you all like maybe like a muscle pi is lagging so you need to like actually bring like strengthen the muscle group so that you actually become stronger and you don't actually commit the you know like
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-62273-65612 commit the exercise in a a negative way lah ya so then or also take take you need to take a lot of rest because like um like they chinese they always say like si si si be the zho ka cha yuan the look ah which means like uh ya resting it go walk longer way but um ya it's actually very true because like um like what i realised right from what i realise if last in the past like when i started training right we actually train every day like seven days a week ya so like every session was like two three hours cause that was after army i had a lot of time ah ya so and then
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-65642-65984 like i didn't really get injured at that time lah but then uh like
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-65987-66595 every time i went to the gym i just sweat a lot but i didn't really see myself uh improving ya so uh
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-66617-67746 how to say ah like you need to like but then after i went to uni right then i didn't have that much time to like actually go to the gym like so i cut my sessions down maybe like four five times a week and i actually saw my strength improve quite a bit
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-67750-68281 because uh like i had no more rest lah like ya then uh
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-68304-71490 actually that's like in intuitive because when you are exercising you need your muscles you need to give time with a muscles rest mah because when you' going to gym you arere actually breaking down the muscle fibres then you need to let them have time to recuperate if not if like let's say you break the muscle fibres the next day they are not even recovered you go and hit them again right they will just become like more and more broken ya i need to allow time for them to heal ya so more rest lor to like prevent injuries and stuff like that ya it's actually quite important ah and the diet is also quite important ya get enough food ya enough protein and then uh get enough sleep ya then everything should be should come in place lah mm
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-72038-72902 ya it take uh two supplements actually i take protein wy protein and uh creatine ya justice two mm
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-72976-73129 why would i
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-73200-73657 oh uh okay so we protein is the one that like many
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-73660-76474 people go to the gym use to like if you want to build muscle lah it's like the go to supplement is the one everybody will start out with so um ya u okay way protein basically when you're trying to like gain strength or gain muscle right you need to hit or certain amount of protein ya uh in your diet and the protein right is actually quite high like u contrary to what other people like believe and so i have done like some calculations for on my own and i okay my body weight is like hundred and sixty pounds so
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-76507-76823 uh by right right they say you need to get like one
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-76825-77966 uh one gram to two grams of protein per pound of poly weight so like for if the like if i consider the minimum amount of protein in it right that's hundred and sixty grams of protein which i need everyday
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-77973-80194 ya and like you might think that that's like quite quite little like that might sound quite little right but then it's actually quite insane like let me let okay let me explain to you like how much is like in one one hundred and sixty grams of protein so like hundred and sixty grams of protein right so uh one carton of milk is usually like thirty eight forty grams of protein ah i say forty grams then one group of protein powder is usually at twenty five grams of protein
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-80209-83257 then one chicken breast uh is twenty five grams of protein so imagine the amount that you have to eat every single day right it to keep the hundred and sixty c grams it is actually quite it scratch quite a lot and for like competitive vi like those who actually like do it for a living one right they have to hit like uh one point five times or to two grams of their body weight so that will be like okay like if they are like my my weight uh my weight class but then uh most probably they will be like a lot heavier than me because they'll be like had they'll be like bigger and stuff like that then they will need to have like four hundred how four hundred and fifty grams of protein
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-83260-83555 okay ya so that's like um
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-83561-83907 i can't really math that well but eighteen chicken breast ya
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-83940-84138 eighteen chicken breast ya
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-84153-84356 e teach j press every single day
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-84416-84569 ya ya like
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-84603-86236 so like those kind of like that's the kind of intensity that they go to lor ya and it's not like it's not like when you are off season ah like let's say when you after you compete you you rest right you can you can stop eating a like eating the high mah protein actually when you're resting right you get you need to get more protein because like in um
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-86241-89028 you want to you want to prevent your muscles from breaking down you know ya so you want to have you need still need to have the amount of protein ya so it's like a lifestyle lah i would say that's why i think like body buildingding is not for everyone you know because not everyone can keep up with this kind of lifestyle healthy eating diet thing and like going to the gym everyday you know a lot of people like to go to the gym lah but when it comes to the diet part like wah it's like not for everyone already ya that's why it's not it's not a spot for everyone lah ya but it's a fun thing to do ah
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-89062-89434 ya sorry i think i think i digress that what was the question
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-89634-89906 oh okay okay ya feeling i digress ah
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-90671-90785 oh um
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-90816-91980 okay like pre pre workout supplements lah they call it's usually like high in caffeine and like okay i' don't i'm not really i don't take it so i don't really know what goes into it but uh basically it just it's just to like wake you up
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-91986-92579 like something like what coffee does you know but uh i feel that it's kind of like fat eh like um like it's all like
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-92615-93073 how to say ah like in the psychological it's like psychological effects lor so
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-93125-93262 so like um
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-93288-94556 um i don't really believe in it but like i know people who don't take it and they take like coffee instead like before they work out ah two shots of black coffee straight and then they go to workout so uh like
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-94582-96422 for everyone they have their own needs lah but i don't i don't need to like wake myself up before like i go to a gym so i don't see i need to take it then post workout is like i i take u away and uh creating post workout lor ya so like is to help in recovery lah and stuff like that ya
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-96896-99124 oh no okay uh mass skinner is for those people who are like really damn like very skinny and like very they find it very hard to put on muscle mass but for me i i'm different cause like my body my body type like i can put on muscle mass easily but i can also get fat easily so if i take if i were to take ma skin i will become damn big but i will become damn fat also ya so i don't want that to happen to me lah so i don't take man skinness ya m
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-99678-101753 caffeine ah uh i don't think so ya i don't i really don't think so the i know that the the way doesn't have creative i'm not very sure but i don't think it has lah because uh u it's not meant okay not it's not meant to be a pre workout supplement so if it's not there then they won't add it in because like if they were to add it in they need to put more money inside now you know into their product so i don't think they will do that
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session3-2-00946-01452 all night out err you can try clarkie ya that's where all the clubs ah
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session3-2-01486-02316 i wouldn't really know cause i don't really go but that's where all the clubs are ya erh clarke you can try clarkie do you need like directions there

S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session3-2-14882-16861 mm oh ya okay sentossa is like a beachfront in singapore so uh is's located ya you have to take a a sky train i think something like that from the harurfront so from uh boon lay you just take the east west line down to bona vista then from bona vista you will take the circle line
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session3-2-16864-17078 all the way down to harbour front
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session3-2-17094-17644 and from upperfront you can take uh the sentosa express to go into sentosa island
